For too long my musical (if you can call them that) experiments have been
scattered all over the internet.  Not anymore!Â  For those who, for whatever
reason, find themselves on my website, there's now a
<i><a href="/music">music</a></i> section.

    par [[
There, one can find a list of all my performances (yes, even the bad ones),
with videos and scores.  The scores are as true to the original as they can be,
and come in pdf and "source code"
(<i><a href="https://musescore.org">musescore</a></i>: if you
don't know about it, you should) form.

    par [[
I have some other plans for that section (and others), but this is what I was
able to put together this weekend.  There may be more updates in the future.

Enjoy.
