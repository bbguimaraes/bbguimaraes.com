Having accidentally found this creek (note: not the River Jordan) in Parco del
Nobile while wandering in the hills in the countryside of Torino, I decided to
record a little version right then and there, even though I'd just learned to

This stream is small but mighty, so much so you can hear the water through the
pick-ups of the guitar, so there is quite a bit of background noise. But at

studio sound) spending the afternoon in this fantastic place. There is nothing
in this world like playing music out in nature. At some point while I was
recording, I even got to make the soundtrack for a bird bathing in the river.
