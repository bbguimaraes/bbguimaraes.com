An unplanned recording, but I've been obsessed with the <i>Unplugged</i> album
for months now (for years really, ever since I bought it, back in the good old
days of CDs and record stores).  How can you resist learning those masterful
songs and guitar parts?

Clapton has always been one of my favorite musicians, and to me this album is
impeccable.  So it's very difficult to choose a favorite, but this might be the
one (but then there's <i>Old love</i>, and <i>Tears in heaven</i>, and â€¦).

The Ibanez is really loud (but it sounds so good!), it's difficult to record
anything else with it.  Better microphone placement next time, but this is what
we get today.

I must be invisible<br />
No one knows me<br />
I have crawled down dead-end streets<br />
On my hands and knees<br />
<br />
I was born with a raging thirst<br />
A hunger to be free<br />
But I've learned through the years<br />
Don't encourage me<br />
<br />
'Cause I'm a lonely stranger here<br />
Well beyond my day<br />
I don't know what's going on<br />
I'll be on my way
