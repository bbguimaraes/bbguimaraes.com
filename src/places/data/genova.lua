Legend says the city was founded by the god Janus, whose two faces watch over
past and future — the ruler of time, of gates and passages, of beginnings and
endings, of traveling, commerce, and sailing, of war and peace, of morning,
birth, journey, transition, and change (it was in honor of him that the Romans
named the first month of the year, <i lang="la">Ianuarius</i>, which marks the
winter solstice and the transition between years).  This is attested by <span

The pictures here are from the three times I have been there — so far — all of
which, appropriately, marked some of the most consequential transitions in my
life.  The most significant was exactly one year ago, as I write this, when I
passed it moving from Lazio to a completely new life — not least because it was
now <em>my country</em> — in my current home, Torino, about 125km north-west.

The people of Liguria are of Celtic origin, distinct from the Greeks, Etruscans,
Romans, and other historic peoples of the Italian peninsula, and the region to
this day has a culture of its own.  Genova, as many Italian city-states, was a
large maritime republic for many centuries, and expanded to many areas along the
Mediterranean and beyond.  To cite a few examples:

Much of the splendor of that time is still visible in its many palaces,
archways, and historic buildings, but it is also possible to get lost in the
labyrinth of medieval alleyways, or in the steep hills with views of the
Mediterranean and the beginning of the Alps, or in the amazing food of the
original home of focaccia and pesto.
