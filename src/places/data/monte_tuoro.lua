One man, when he has done a service to another, is ready to set it down to his
account as a favour conferred.  Another is not ready to do this, but still in
his own mind he thinks of the man as his debtor, and he knows what he has done.
A third in a manner does not even know what he has done, but he is like a vine
which has produced grapes, and seeks for nothing more after it has once produced
its proper fruit.  As a horse when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the
game, a bee when it has made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act,
does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as
a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season.
