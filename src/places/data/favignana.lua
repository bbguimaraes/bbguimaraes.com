My first stop in Sicily — and I could not have chosen a better one — was
Favignana, the largest of the <a
href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1405747">Aegadian Islands</a>.
These are an archipelago of five islands in the Strait of Sicily, the closest
about 7km from its western end, in the region of
<a href="trapani.html">Trapani</a> and Marsala.  The Greeks called them <span
lang="grc">Aἰγάται Νῆσοι</span> (<i>Aigátai Nésoi</i>, <span lang="la">Aegates
Insulae</span> in Latin), the “islands of the goats” (making them etymologicaly
related to <a href="capri.html">Capri</a>), and according to English novelist
Samuel Butler, author of a distinguished translation of Homer's Odyssey in 1900,
their Ἱερά Νήσος (<i>Hierá Nésos</i>, “holy island”), the island of Marettimo,
furthest from the coast, is none other than Ithaca, the famous homeland that
Odysseus seeks throughout the epic.

    par [[
Regardless of the veracity of this claim, the islands have significant
historical importance, as can be seen from the archaeological remains from the
Paleolithic Era (back in the glacial period when all of Italy, Sicily, and its
islands were connected and more easily reachable from Africa) and the Punic wars
found all over the surrounding sea.  Even though I would have liked to visit
them all, the short time available to stay in each place meant I had to make
sacrifices: here I had to choose only one of the islands.
]],
    par [[
Favignana ended up being my choice; not that it is any less illustrious than its
sisters: it was the famous site of the major naval victory of the Romans over
the Carthaginians in 241 B.C., which marked the end of the first Punic war and
the annexation of Sicily as their first province, later establishing Rome's
dominance as the supreme ruler of the Mediterranean, surpassing even the mighty
Greeks, who had had their own conflicts with the same enemies for centuries at
this point.  All this by the somewhat obscure general Gaius Lutatius Catulus, a
<i lang="la">novus homó</i> who won this battle only to fade again into history.
This event is still celebrated in Favignana more than two thousand years later —
and I have <em>two</em> shirts to prove it (this is why I love Italy).

    html "<hr />",
    par [[
Favignana is the perfect exemplar of the Scilian islands.  Other than monte
Santa Caterina at its center, the land is mostly flat, making its coast ideal to
be explored by walking or cycling.  And cycle I did: in one afternoon, I went
through its entire 33km perimeter.  The reward for doing so are some of the most
surreal landscapes in all of Italy.
]],
    par [[
The islands of Sicily are miniatures of itself, with mountains descending
steeply into beaches of the crystal-clear water of the central Mediterranean,
with volcanic rocks and exotic, exuberant vegetation all over them.  I have
never seen sea water so transparent, and of an azure-turquoise color so intense
it is almost offensive to the senses.
]],
    par [[
A curious feature of the island are the ever-present quarries: colossal sections
of rock (calcarenite, a type of limestone) which have been cut in precise right
angles to be used for buildings — the famous Duomo di Monreale is one example of
a construction done using limestone from Favignana.  It was historically an
important source of this type of material, and these sites can still be seen
throughout the island, including and especially along the coast, where caves
were opened in cliffs right next to the sea.
]],
    par [[
In some places the protection from wind and abundance of sun and water provided
by these artificially lowered surfaces have created the conditions for rich
vegetation to develop — the famous <i>hypogeum gardens</i> of Favignana (from
Greek <span lang="grc">ὑπο- + γῆ + -ῐος</span>, “under the ground”).
