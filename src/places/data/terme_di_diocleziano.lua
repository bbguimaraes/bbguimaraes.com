I could spend the rest of my life in Rome: every time I am there I end up
spending hours in a single, small part of it, not seeing nearly enough, and
leaving thinking I will have to return at least once more.  This particular
time, it was this monumental complex of public baths, built at the turn of the
IV century.  Located in the northeastern part of the city center, right next to
the main train station, Roma Termini, it can be easily visited even during a
short stay, as mine was.

    par [[
Built around the time of the emperor Diocletianus, they were the largest public
baths of the empire, with a maximum capacity of 3000 people and an area of
around 32 acres.  After falling in disuse as a result of the interruption by the
Goths of the large aqueduct which was their source of water, following the fall
of the empire, the area was restored over centuries and has served many
different purposes; to name a few: it was the birthplace of Museo Nazionale
Romano, houses the basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli (which, together with
the inner cloister, was designed by Michelangelo in the XVI century), and
supplies water for Fontana delle Naiadi in Piazza della Repubblica.
]],
    par [[
Other than the remains themselves, the area around Michelangelo's cloister has
an exhibition on the early development of civilization in the Latium (the region
which gives both the Latin language and the modern region of Lazio their name),
starting from the Bronze Age, millennia before Rome, the Republic, and the
Empire; right next to it the epigraphic section has historical artefacts of
Greek and Roman writing; finally, there are archaeological finds from the baths
themselves as well as other areas of the city.

The main reason for my visit was to see a few famous items housed there (at
least “famous” for those like me).  First, a piece of pottery containing the
earliest evidence of writing found in Italy, from the VIII century B.C. (the
time of Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>).  Its Greek inscription is
among the three oldest ever found, together with the ones found in <a
href="ischia.html">Ischia</a> and Athens.
]],
    par [[
Then, there is a stone tablet, a funerary inscription, containing one of the
oldest Christian writings, from the III century: <span lang="grc">“ιχθυς
ζωντων“</span>, the “fish of the living”, which has been used as a symbol since
the earliest period of Christianity (sometimes covertly) as, beyond the
evangelical symbolism, its letters form the initials of the phrase:

    blockquote [[
<span lang="grc">Ἰησοῦς Χρῑστός Θεοῦ Υἱός Σωτήρ</span><br />
Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior
]],
    par [[
Lastly, the object of my greatest interest: a mosaic found in a tomb in via
Appia with the Roman Greek inscription: <span lang="grc">“Γνωθι σαυτον“</span>.
This is the most famous of the <i>Delphic maxims</i>, a set of three phrases
written on the temple of Apollo in Delphi, home of the Pythian prophetess:
]],
    blockquote [[
<span lang="grc">Γνῶθι σεαυτόν</span>
– know thyself
<br />
<span lang="grc">Μηδὲν ἄγαν</span>
– nothing in excess
<br />
<span lang="grc">Ἐγγύα πάρα δ' Ἄτα</span>
– give a pledge and trouble is at hand
]],
    par [[
It was Socrates (who, as told by Plato and Xenophon, was named the wisest man by
that very same priestess at the temple of Delphi) the first to give it its
fullest meaning:

I am not yet able, as the Delphic inscription has it, to know myself; so it
seems to me ridiculous, when I do not yet know that, to investigate irrelevant
things. And so I dismiss these matters and accepting the customary belief about
them, as I was saying just now, I investigate not these things, but myself, to
know whether I am a monster more complicated and more furious than Typhon or a
gentler and simpler creature, to whom a divine and quiet lot is given by nature.

But it is the magnificent <i>De Legibus</i> of Cicero which perfectly
synthesizes the unparalleled impact of this terse two-word precept on the
millennia of philosophical debate since its writing:

Est huius uero disputationis, Quinte, proprium, id quod expectas, atque utinam

doctrina ducatur.  Ita fit ut mater omnium bonarum rerum sit sapientia, a quoius
amore Graeco uerbo philosophia nomen inuenit, qua nihil a dis immortalibus
uberius, nihil florentius, nihil praestabilius hominum uitae datum est.  Haec
enim una nos cum ceteras res omnes, tum, quod est difficillimum, docuit, ut

And indeed what you expect, my Quintus, harmonizes very well with the subjects
of our present discussion.  And I wish that it were within my abilities to do
justice to it.  But the real state of the case is, that since law ought to be
both a correctress of vice and a recommender of virtue, the principles on which
we direct our conduct ought to be drawn from her.  And, thus it comes to pass
wisdom is the mother of all the virtuous arts, from the love of which the Greeks
have composed the word Philosophy; and which is beyond all contradiction the
richest, the brightest, and the most excellent of the gifts which the Gods have
bestowed on the life of mankind.  For wisdom alone has taught us, among other
things, the most difficult of all lessons, namely, to <i>know ourselves</i>, a
precept so forcible and so comprehensive, that it has been attributed not to a
man, but to the God of Delphi himself.
