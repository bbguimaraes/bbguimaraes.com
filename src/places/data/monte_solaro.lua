Climbing monte Solaro in the island of <a href="capri.html">Capri</a>.  The path
begins in Porto di Marina Grande, right after leaving the boat.  It goes up
through tiny streets and stairs along the Northern portion of the town of Capri,
then begins an almost vertical ascent through Scala Fenicia, a stairway built on
the face of the mount in the 7th century B.C. by the Greek colonizers of the
island (there are no pictures at this point because I was busy trying to survive
the almost 1000 steps).

From there it proceeds less strenuously through Villa San Michele, monte
Cappello, and the Eremo di Santa Maria a Cetrella, and arrives in monte Solaro
after another ~45° climb.  From the top, another trail climbs down to Punta
Carena and Sentiero Forino (<a href="monte-tuoro.html">those will have to remain
for another day</a>).

    par [[
Visiting this type of place in winter is great because they are almost deserted.
Outside the city centers, other than the occasional “buongiorno” exchange with a
few locals on the sentieri, you have the island mostly for yourself.  Well, that
and the group I found just after reaching the top, seen in the last couple of
pictures.

    par [[
It's unclear whether the name of the island comes from Greek κάπρος (kápros,
“boar”) or Latin caprea (“female goat”), I present evidence for the latter.
This group, the only contact with living beings I had that afternoon, was right
on the trail leading down to Punta della Chiavica, but they made way as soon as
I approached (not without some timid and adorable intimidation attempts from the
young males).
