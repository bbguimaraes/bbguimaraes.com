The last stop of my marathon in the Gulf of Napoli.  I had become so enamored of
the island from watching it all the way across the Gulf of Gaeta, more than 60km
away — it is located right between the two gulfs, in the area where Campi
Flegrei, the huge volcanic caldera, enters the Mediterranean sea, forming
Penisola flegrea and the surrounding islands — seeing its dim figure through the
maritime mist, its shaded contour against the colored sky at sunset, its dark
green suspended in the bright blue where both sky and sea meet on sunny days

Napoli, the <a href="napoli.html" lang="grc">Νεάπολις</a>, and the surrounding
area was the center of <span lang="la">Magna Graecia</span>, the Greek colonies
in southern Italy, and the settlement of Ischia goes back to the 9th century
B.C. as a trading post in the Mediterranean.  Its archaeological museum is home
to one of the earliest inscriptions in the Greek language ever found, a cup made
in an Aegean island in the 8th century B.C., discovered just 70 years ago in a
tomb in the island.

The trip from Napoli starts in
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4822113914">Porta di Massa</a>, the
port at the center of the city, from which also depart boats to
<a href="capri.html">Capri</a> and other destinations in and around the gulf.
It takes about 90 minutes for the ferry to get there (the faster hydrofoil takes
just over an hour), but that is hardly noticeable, since there isn't a single
minute along the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/501455083">path</a>
without beautiful views of the coast, <a href="napoli.html">the city of
Napoli</a>, the
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/437376371">island of Nisida</a>,
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/11828883740">Capo di Posillipo</a>,
the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/10723501">island of
Procida</a>, etc., as well as those across the gulf:
<a href="vesuvius.html">Vesuvius</a>, <a href="capri.html">Capri</a>, and the
<a href="sorrento.html">Sorrento</a> peninsula.

There was no chance I could explore the entire island (it is the largest in the
region, almost 50km²), since I had only a single day to visit it, so I just
decided to explore without planning much in advance (but that also just means
I'll have to return =).

    par [[
The day started very sunny, and the deep azure typical of the waters of the Gulf
was displayed in its full glory all along the northeastern coast, from Punta San
Pietro all the way to the castle.  After a stop for lunch and a bus trip to the
village of Fontana, the weather turned very misty as I made my way to
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/26863248">monte Epomeo</a>, the
highest point of the island (788m) and, by the time I got to the summit, it was
almost completely surrounded by clouds and the shore, just a few kilometers
away, was barely visible.

    par [[
Climbing down the mount straight towards the south leads to the thermal waters
of Sant'Angelo, where the high sulphur content of the volcanic water springs
creates a natural swimming pool spanning the entire coast.  As the sun was
starting to set, all I had time left for was another bus ride to the port to
take the ferry back to Napoli, where the day ended with some pasta, seafood, and
vino alla spina (naturally) in <a href="https://www.isaporidiparthenope.it">I
Sapori di Parthenope</a>, a great local restaurant next to the central station I
had to visit a second time.
