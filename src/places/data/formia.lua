As many of the cities along the Tyrrhenian coast on the ancient via Appia,
Formia was a favored place for Roman seaside villae — including one belonging to
the stepfather of the emperor Augustus.  Its Greek name <span
lang="grc">Όρμιαι</span> (<span lang="la">Hormiae</span> in Latin, from a word
for “harbor”) refers to its many ports and the mild maritime climate provided by
its surroundings: the gulf of Gaeta and the monti Aurunci.  The remains of many
of these villae and ports can still be seen all they from the city center to the
rocky shore on the way to <a
href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8390626221">monte Scauri</a>, with
salient pieces of two-thousand-year-old mosaics coming out of the rock every now
and then.

One of the most famous residents of Formiae was the illustrious <i
lang="la">novus homo</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero"
lang="la">Marcus Tulius Cicero</a>.  It was there, on via Appia in 43 A.D., that
he was assassinated by order of Marcus Antoninus, after criticizing both him and
Julius Caesar throughout the decadent period which led to the Empire and
admonishing Romans to return to the old Republican values — one of his most
famous phrases, <span lang="la">“O tempora, o mores”</span>, “O times!  O
customs!”, comes from this period.
]],
    par [[
For both his implacable resistance and eminence as a public citizen, Cicero
received the harshest punishment of all opponents of Antoninus: his severed head
and his hands were displayed in the Roman Forum as strong discouragement of
dissent.  The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/159656918">monument</a>
housing his tomb lies on a stretch of the via Appia just outside of Formia now
named after him: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/48503665"
lang="it">via Marco Tulio Cicerone</a>.
