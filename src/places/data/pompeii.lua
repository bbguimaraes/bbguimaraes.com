If you are obsessed with Ancient Rome as I am (as I hope you are), you knew this
was coming.  After the Palatine hill in Rome itself, the most famous Roman ruins
which survive to this day are certainly the city of Pompeii.  As its neighbor <a
href="herculaneum.html">Herculaneum</a>, it was at the time at the seaside
(built on top of a layer of lava from a previous eruption), it was buried under
several meters of volcanic material expelled from <a href="vesuvius.html">mount
Vesuvius</a> in 79 AD, remained lost for more than a millennium and a half until
it was accidentally rediscovered, and now provides an unbelievable view into
what life was like in the Roman empire two thousand years ago.

Unlike Herculaneum, which can comfortably be seen in its entirety in less than a
day, it was a much bigger city, with ten to twenty thousand inhabitants and an
excavated area of around 3.5km — although not as wealthy as the neighboring
seaside retreat, with its abundance of exuberant villae.  It has also been more
thoroughly explored by archaeologists: since the layer of material which covered
it was not as deep (4–6 m), it was discovered earlier, in 1592, and only ⅓ still
remains buried.  It was, however, much more directly hit by the destructive
force of the eruption, so much less of the original structures was preserved.

    par [[
Here too the excavation process continues to this day, balanced with the need to
preserve the parts which have already been unearthed and suffer constant
degradation by the elements and the visitors.  E.g.: when I was there, a large
section called “<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/335245563">Regio
IX</a>” was closed, a few months later the excavation of a house with a large
dining hall covered in frescoes was <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68777741">announced</a>.  A
look at the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c5xwz7wg3rzt">news</a> from
the past few years demonstrates how these sites are a constant source of
discoveries from that period in history.

And, of course, the amphitheater was where the famous Pink Floyd <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd%3A_Live_at_Pompeii">concert</a>
was recorded in 1972.  I was pleasantly surprised to find an exhibition about it
in the galleries there — and reminded of my age when I saw many “youths” pass by
in absolute ignorance of what the exhibition was about.

When I give myself to my friends, I do not withdraw from my own company, nor do
I linger with those who are associated with me through some special occasion or
some case which arises from my official position.  But I spend my time in the

age, I let my thoughts fly to them.
