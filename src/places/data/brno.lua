In thinking these thoughts, Siddhartha stopped once again, suddenly, as if there
was a snake lying in front of him on the path.  Because suddenly, he had also
become aware of this: He, who was indeed like someone who had just woken up or
like a newborn baby, he had to start his life anew and start again at the very
beginning.  When he had left in this very morning from the grove Jetavana, the
grove of that exalted one, already awakening, already on the path towards
himself, he had every intention, regarded as natural and took for granted, that
he, after years as an ascetic, would return to his home and his father.  But
now, only in this moment, when he stopped as if a snake was lying on his path,
he also awoke to this realization: 'But I am no longer the one I was, I am no
ascetic any more, I am not a priest any more, I am no Brahmin any more.
Whatever should I do at home and at my father's place?  Study?  Make offerings?
Practise meditation?  But all this is over, all of this is no longer alongside
my path'.

Motionless, Siddhartha remained standing there, and for the time of one moment
and breath, his heart felt cold, he felt a cold in his chest, as a small animal,
a bird or a rabbit, would when seeing how alone he was.  For many years, he had
been without home and had felt nothing.  Now, he felt it.  Still, even in the
deepest meditation, he had been his father's son, had been a Brahmin, of a high
caste, a cleric.  Now, he was nothing but Siddhartha, the awoken one, nothing
else was left.  Deeply, he inhaled, and for a moment, he felt cold and shivered.
Nobody was thus alone as he was.  There was no nobleman who did not belong to
the noblemen, no worker that did not belong to the workers, and found refuge
with them, shared their life, spoke their language.  No Brahmin who would not be
regarded as Brahmins and lived with them, no ascetic who would not find his
refuge in the caste of the Samanas, and even the most forlorn hermit in the
forest was not just one and alone, he was also surrounded by a place he belonged
to, he also belonged to a caste, in which he was at home.  Govinda had become a
monk, and a thousand monks were his brothers, wore the same robe as he, believed
in his faith, spoke his language.  But he, Siddhartha, where did he belong to?
With whom would he share his life?  Whose language would he speak?  Out of this
moment, when the world melted away all around him, when he stood alone like a
star in the sky, out of this moment of a cold and despair, Siddhartha emerged,
more a self than before, more firmly concentrated.  He felt: This had been the
last tremor of the awakening, the last struggle of this birth.  And it was not
long until he walked again in long strides, started to proceed swiftly and
impatiently, heading no longer for home, no longer to his father, no longer
back.
