One of the two major early-Mediaeval peregrination routes across Western Europe
— the other being, of course, the famous Camino de Santiago, which it predates
by a few centuries and to which it is roughly perpendicular.  Beginning in
Canterbury (specifically, Canterbury Cathedral, seat of the Archbishop of the
Church of England), at the southeastern corner of Britain near the Thames
estuary, it crosses France, Switzerland, and the entirety of the Italian
peninsula, passing through Rome and ending in Santa Maria di Leuca in Puglia,
the southeastern end of Italy, after more than three thousand kilometers.  From
there pilgrims would sail across the Mediterranean to the Holy Land.  Thus it
connects, together with Camino de Santiago, Compostela, Canterbury, Rome, and
Jerusalem, the main peregrination sites of Christianity.

Its southeastern portion in Lazio, departing from Rome, follows the ancient via
Appia, the Roman <i>regina viarum</i>, and I had the chance to visit many places
on that route during my brief stay there: <a href="gaeta.html">Gaeta</a>,
Formia, Scauri, <a href="minturno.html">Minturno</a> (and the archeological site
of <a href="minturnae.html">Minturnae</a>), <a href="minturno.html">Santi Cosma
e Damiano</a>, <a href="castelforte.html">Castelforte</a>, and <a
href="suio.html">Suio</a> (see those for more, I won't repost the pictures
here), after which it crosses the Garigliano river into Campania.  The entire
path is demarcated by signs directing the way and, more than just the road
(although that is itself an attraction), there are endless natural, cultural,
and historical wonders along the way.
