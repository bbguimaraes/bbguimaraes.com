Some literary works are considered great for their content alone, but a few can
also be credited with altering the course of history.  In the case of the
horrors of the 20th century, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's <i>The Gulag
Archipelago</i> is thought of as "the book which brought down the Soviet Union";
it certainly deserves the title, but it was one in a vast network of <span

subverted the heavy censorship of the Soviet bloc.

Václav Havel, a poet and playwright who later became Czechoslovakia's last
president, and subsequently the first of the newly-formed Czech Republic, was
the author of one of these works.  His focus is not on grandiose political
ideas: rather, his thesis is that it is in ordinary people, the seemingly
<i>powerless</i>, where in truth all power resides.  Such ideological systems
are a reflection of their own faults, of <i>living in a lie</i>, and so it is in
their capacity, and their responsibility, to oppose them by <i>living within the
truth</i>.

A major concern of the book is the correct identification of the conditions
which allowed the establishment of the Soviet system.  For this, it rejects the
"messianic" propositions of political theories.  It has no "ideal project" which
is to be imposed on the "unconscious" masses.  On the contrary, Havel
concentrates on what he calls the <i>pre-political</i>: his battle is neither
political, social, nor military, but takes place in "the obscure arena of being
itself".

    par [[
By the time the essay was written, the heroism of the communist revolution had
long faded, and even the attempts to resurrect some of those ideals via
political means (some of which Havel had direct participation in) had failed.
Ideology was perpetuated because of, in his words, a <i>deep moral crisis</i>.
]],
    blockquote [[
[Our system] commands an incomparably more precise, logically structured,
generally comprehensible and, in essence, extremely flexible ideology that, in
its elaborateness and completeness, is almost a secularized religion.  It offers
a ready answer to any question whatsoever; it can scarcely be accepted only in
part, and accepting it has profound implications for human life.  In an era when
metaphysical and existential certainties are in a state of crisis, when people
are being uprooted and alienated and are losing their sense of what this world
means, this ideology inevitably has a certain hypnotic charm.  To wandering
humankind it offers an immediately available home: all one has to do is accept
it, and suddenly everything becomes clear once more, life takes on new meaning,
and all mysteries, unanswered questions, anxiety, and loneliness vanish.  Of
course, one pays dearly for this low-rent home: the price is abdication of one's
own reason, conscience, and responsibility, for an essential aspect of this
ideology is the consignment of reason and conscience to a higher authority.

It is this which more than anything made the book relevant even outside the

The essential aims of life are present naturally in every person. In everyone
there is some longing for humanity’s rightful dignity, for moral integrity, for
free expression of being and a sense of transcendence over the world of
existence. Yet, at the same time, each person is capable, to a greater or lesser
degree, of coming to terms with living within the lie. Each person somehow
succumbs to a profane trivialization of his inherent humanity, and to
utilitarianism. In everyone there is some willingness to merge with the
anonymous crowd and to flow comfortably along with it down the river of
pseudolife. This is much more than a simple conflict between two identities.  It
is something far worse: it is a challenge to the very notion of identity itself.

The apathy and complacency of those who choose to display signs of their

product of some diabolical higher will"; as Solzhenitsyn famously wrote, "the
line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes,
nor between political parties either &mdash; but right through every human heart
&mdash; and through all human hearts".  Prime-minister and greengrocer are
equally "unfree" in their ignominy.

statement of his own degradation in the shop window, and quite naturally so, for
he is a human being and thus has a sense of his own dignity.

It is through their failures, and because of them, that such an ideological
system develops.  Only in this condition of moral degeneration can other forces
take command.  But it is also their willing participation that provides the
conditions for the perpetuation of this system, as Havel incisively identifies.
It vests their dishonorable conduct with a semblance of morality, and that
conduct is rewarded with something which on the surface resembles character,
without requiring any real virtue.  A co-dependence is created between the
system and those involved in it.  Life becomes a "world of appearances trying to

Ideology is a specious way of relating to the world.  It offers human beings the

true position and their inglorious <i>modus vivendi</i>, both from the world and

solidarity with those whom his conscience commands him to support.  In this
revolt the greengrocer steps out of living within the lie.  He rejects the

is an attempt to <em>live within the truth</em>.

The profound crisis of human identity brought on by living within a lie, a
crisis which in turn makes such a life possible, certainly possesses a moral
dimension as well; it appears, among other things, as <em>a deep moral crisis in
society</em>.  A person who has been seduced by the consumer value system, whose
identity is dissolved in an amalgam of the accouterments of mass civilization,
and who has no roots in the order of being, no sense of responsibility for
anything higher than his own personal survival, is a <em>demoralized</em>
person.  The system depends on this demoralization, deepens it, is in fact a
projection of it into society.

Living within the truth, as humanity's revolt against an enforced position, is,
on the contrary, an attempt to regain control over one's own sense of

risk may bring rewards in the form of a general amelioration in the situation,

His proposition, however, is far from being delusionally naive: there is no
attempt to disguise the fact that the consequences of such revolt are dire and
possibly fatal.  In fact, the book is dedicated to Jan Patočka, a philosopher
who died following police interrogation.  The "world of appearances" has to be
maintained by force, since it is not rooted in reality.  It is only because it
is so pervasive as to form the "panorama of everyday life" that it can continue
to exist virtually unnoticed, and any attempt of self-determination is an attack
against it.

The greengrocer has not committed a simple, individual offense, isolated in its
own uniqueness, but something incomparably more serious.  By breaking the rules
of the game, he has disrupted the game as such.  He has exposed it as a mere
game.  He has shattered the world of appearances, the fundamental pillar of the
system.  He has upset the power structure by tearing apart what holds it
together.  He has demonstrated that living a lie is living a lie.  He has broken
through the exalted facade of the system and exposed the real, base foundations
of power.  He has said that the emperor is naked.  And because the emperor is in
fact naked, something extremely dangerous has happened: by his action, the
greengrocer has addressed the world.  He has enabled everyone to peer behind the
curtain.  He has shown everyone that it is possible to live within the truth.
Living within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal.  The
principle must embrace and permeate everything.  There are no terms whatsoever
on which it can co-exist with living within the truth, and therefore everyone
who steps out of line <em>denies it in principle and threatens it in its
entirety</em>.

    par [[
Truth is <em>antithetical</em> to a life of lies, and it cannot be tolerated in
that environment.  The entire system must dismiss or suppress it; and because it
is in the end a projection of the will of those who compose it, this means those
very people will revolt against this truthful existence.  As the inhabitants of
Plato's cave, they will turn against those who would point the way to freedom
from their own prison.
]],
    blockquote [[
This is understandable: as long as appearance is not confronted with reality, it
does not seem to be appearance.  As long as living a lie is not confronted with
living the truth, the perspective needed to expose its mendacity is lacking.  As
soon as the alternative appears, however, it threatens the very existence of
appearance and living a lie in terms of what they are, both their essence and
their all-inclusiveness.  And at the same time, it is utterly unimportant how
large a space this alternative occupies: its power does not consist in its
physical attributes but in the light it casts on those pillars of the system and
on its unstable foundations.  After all, the greengrocer was a threat to the
system not because of any physical or actual power he had, but because his
action went beyond itself, because it illuminated its surroundings and, of
course, because of the incalculable consequences of that illumination.  In the
post-totalitarian system, therefore, living within the truth has more than a
mere existential dimension (returning humanity to its inherent nature), or a
noetic dimension (revealing reality as it is), or a moral dimension (setting an
example for others).  It also has an unambiguous <em>political</em> dimension.
If the main pillar of the system is living a lie, then it is not surprising that
the fundamental threat to it is living the truth.  This is why it must be
suppressed more severely than anything else.

this approach, perhaps the most mature stage so far, is what Václav Benda called

In this "second culture" or "parallel polis", writers, philosophers, historians,
sociologists, teachers, clergymen, painters, musicians, singers, etc. all become

endorsement of elitism or radical individualism (never has this been a more

Historical experience teaches us that any genuinely meaningful point of
departure in an individuals life usually has an element of universality about
it.  In other words, it is not something partial, accessible only to a
restricted community, and not transferable to any other.  On the contrary, it
must be potentially accessible to everyone; it must foreshadow a general
solution and, thus, it is not just the expression of an introverted,
self-contained responsibility that individuals have to and for themselves alone,
but responsibility to and for the <em>world</em>.  Thus it would be quite wrong
to understand the parallel structures and the parallel <i>polis</i> as a retreat
into a ghetto and as an act of isolation, addressing itself only to the welfare
of those who had decided on such a course, and who are indifferent to the rest.
It would be wrong, in short, to consider it an essentially group solution that
has nothing to do with the general situation.  Such a concept would, from the
start, alienate the notion of living within the truth from its proper point of
departure, which is concern for others, transforming it ultimately into just
another more sophisticated version of living within a lie.

While it is each individual's mission to act in accordance with their own
convictions, that still happens in the realm of objective reality.  Throughout
the text, living in a lie has been contrasted with living within <em>the</em>
truth (the definite article is crucial).  This "second culture" still has an
obligation to the common social sphere, and in fact can only derive its meaning
from it: if it isolated itself in its own reality, it would be no less
"schizophrenic" than the people acting in accordance with the system.
The relation to Christian morality ("catholic", from the Greek <span

obvious and it is used here as a model.

Patočka used to say that the most interesting thing about responsibility is that
we carry it with us everywhere.  That means that responsibility is ours, that we
must accept it and grasp it here, now, in this place in time and space where the
Lord has set us down, and that we cannot lie our way out of it by moving
somewhere else, whether it be to an Indian ashram or to a parallel <i>polis</i>.
If Western young people so often discover that retreat to an Indian monastery
fails them as an individual or group solution, then this is obviously because,
and only because, it lacks that element of universality, since not everyone can
retire to an ashram.  Christianity is an example of an opposite way out: it is a
point of departure for me here and now &mdash; but only because anyone,
anywhere, at any time, may avail themselves of it.  In other words, the parallel
<i>polis</i> points beyond itself and makes sense only as an act of deepening
one's responsibility to and for the whole, as a way of discovering the most
appropriate locus for this responsibility, not as an escape from it.

terríveis e potencialmente fatais.  De fato, o livro é dedicado a Jan Patočka,
filósofo que morreu após interrogação da polícia.  O "mundo de aparências" tem
que ser mantido pela força, já que não é radicado na realidade.  É só porque é
tão permeante a ponto de formar o "panorama da vida quotidiana" que pode
continuar a existir virtualmente despercebido, e qualquer tentativa de
autodeterminação é um ataque contra ele.

O verdureiro não cometeu uma ofensa simples, individual, isolada em sua
singularidade, mas algo incomparavelmente mais sério.  Quebrando as regras do
jogo, perturbou o jogo em si.  Expôs o jogo como um mero jogo.  Estilhaçou o
mundo de aparências, o pilar fundamental do sistema.  Perturbou a estrutura de
poder destruindo o que a mantém junta.  Demonstrou que viver numa mentira é
viver numa mentira.  Penetrou a fachada exaltada do sistema e expôs as reais,
baixas fundações do poder.  Disse que o imperador está nu.  E porque o imperador
de fato está nu, algo extremamente perigoso aconteceu: por sua ação, o
verdureiro se endereçou ao mundo.  Habilitou todos a verem por trás da cortina.
Mostrou a todos que é possível viver na verdade.  Viver numa mentira só pode
constituir o sistema se for universal.  O princípio deve abraçar e permear tudo.
Não existem quaisquer termos em que pode coexistir com o viver na verdade, e por
isso todos os que saem da linha <em>rejeitam-no em princípio e ameaçam-no em sua
totalidade</em>.

A verdade é <em>antitética</em> a uma vida de mentiras, e não pode ser tolerada
nesse ambiente.  O sistema inteiro tem que dispensá-la ou suprimi-la; e porque é
finalmente uma projeção da vontade daqueles que o compõem, isso significa que
essas próprias pessoas se revoltarão contra a existência verdadeira.  Como os
habitantes da caverna de Platão, vão se voltar contra aqueles que apontam o

Isso é entendível: enquanto as aparências não são confrontadas com a realidade,
não parecem ser aparências.  Enquanto viver numa mentira não é confrontado com
viver na verdade, a perspectiva necessária para expôr sua mendácia não existe.
Assim que a alternativa aparece, no entanto, ameaça a própria existência das
aparências e da vida numa mentira em termos do que são, tanto em sua essência
quanto em seu alcance absoluto.  E ao mesmo tempo, é totalmente irrelevante quão
grande é o espaço ocupado por essa alternativa: seu poder não consiste nos seus
atributos físicos mas na luz que projeta naqueles pilares do sistema e em suas
fundações instáveis.  Enfim, o verdureiro era uma ameaça ao sistema não por
qualquer poder físico ou de fato que tinha, mas porque sua ação foi além dele,
porque iluminou seus arredores e, é claro, por causa das consequências
incalculáveis dessa iluminação.  No sistema pós-totalitário, dessa forma, viver
na verdade tem mais que uma dimensão existencial (retornando a humanidade à sua
natureza inerente), ou uma dimensão noética (revelando a realidade como é), ou
uma dimensão moral (estabelecendo um exemplo aos outros).  Também tem uma
dimensão inequivocamente <em>política</em>.  Se o pilar principal do sistema é
viver numa mentira, então não é surpresa que a principal ameaça a ela seja viver
na verdade.  É por isso que deve ser suprimido mais severamente que qualquer
outra coisa.

Experiência histórica nos ensina que qualquer ponto de partida genuinamente
significativo na vida de um indivíduo geralmente tem um elemento de
universalidade sobre ele.  Em outras palavras, não é algo parcial, acessível
somente a uma comunidade restrita, e não-transferível a qualquer outra.  Pelo
contrário, deve ser potencialmente acessível a todos; deve prever uma solução
geral e, assim, não é só a expressão de uma responsabilidade introvertida e
auto-contida que indivíduos têm por e para eles mesmos somente, mas
responsabilidade por e para o <em>mundo</em>.  Assim seria muito errado entender
as estruturas paralelas e a polis paralela como um retiro a uma periferia e como
um ato de isolamento, endereçando a si mesmo somente para o bem-estar daqueles
que decidiram seguir tal curso, e que é indiferente ao resto.  Seria errado,
brevemente, considerá-las uma solução de grupo que não tem relação com a
situação geral.  Tal conceito, do início, alienaria a noção de viver na verdade

One legacy of that original "correct understanding" is a third peculiarity that
makes our systems different from other modern dictatorships: it commands an
incomparably more precise, logically structured, generally comprehensible and,
in essence, extremely flexible ideology that, in its elaborateness and
completeness, is almost a secularized religion.  It offers a ready answer to any
question whatsoever; it can scarcely be accepted only in part, and accepting it
has profound implications for human life.  In an era when metaphysical and
existential certainties are in a state of crisis, when people are being uprooted
and alienated and are losing their sense of what this world means, this ideology
inevitably has a certain hypnotic charm.  To wandering humankind it offers an
immediately available home: all one has to do is accept it, and suddenly
everything becomes clear once more, life takes on new meaning, and all
mysteries, unanswered questions, anxiety, and loneliness vanish.  Of course, one
pays dearly for this low-rent home: the price is abdication of one's own reason,
conscience, and responsibility, for an essential aspect of this ideology is the
consignment of reason and conscience to a higher authority.  The principle
involved here is that the center of power is identical with the center of truth.

The manager of a fruit-and-vegetable shop places in his window, among the onions

I think it can safely be assumed that the overwhelming majority of shopkeepers
never think about the slogans they put in their windows, nor do they use them to
express their real opinions.  That poster was delivered to our greengrocer from
the enterprise head-quarters along with the onions and carrots.  He put them all

everyone does it, and because that is the way it has to be.  If he were to
refuse, there could be trouble.  He could be reproached for not having the
proper decoration in his window; someone might even accuse him of disloyalty.
He does it because these things must be done if one is to get along in life.  It
is one of the thousands of details that guarantee him a relatively tranquil life

Obviously the greengrocer is indifferent to the semantic content of the slogan
on exhibit; he does not put the slogan in his window from any personal desire to
acquaint the public with the ideal it expresses.  This, of course, does not mean
that his action has no motive or significance at all, or that the slogan
communicates nothing to anyone.  The slogan is really a <em>sign</em>, and as
such it contains a subliminal but very definite message.  Verbally, it might be
expressed this way: "I, the greengrocer XY, live here and I know what I must do.
I behave in the manner expected of me.  I can be depended upon and am beyond
reproach.  I am obedient and therefore I have the right to be left in peace".
This message, of course, has an addressee: it is directed above, to the
greengrocer's superior, and at the same time it is a shield that protects the
greengrocer from potential informers.  The slogan's real meaning, therefore, is
rooted firmly in the greengrocer's existence.  It reflects his vital interests.
But what are those vital interests?

Let us take note: if the greengrocer had been instructed to display the slogan
"I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient", he would not be nearly as

The greengrocer would be embarrassed and ashamed to put such an unequivocal
statement of his own degradation in the shop window, and quite naturally so, for
he is a human being and thus has a sense of his own dignity.  To overcome this
complication, his expression of loyalty must take the form of a sign which, at
least on its textual surface, indicates a level of disinterested conviction.  It
must allow the greengrocer to say, "What's wrong with the workers of the world
uniting"'.  Thus the sign helps the greengrocer to conceal from himself the low
foundations of his obedience, at the same time concealing the low foundations of
power.  It hides them behind the facade of something high.  And that something
is <em>ideology</em>.

Ideology is a specious way of relating to the world.  It offers human beings the
illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while making it easier for
them to <em>part</em> with them.  As the repository of something suprapersonal
and objective, it enables people to deceive their conscience and conceal their
true position and their inglorious <i>modus vivendi</i>, both from the world and
from themselves.  It is a very pragmatic but, at the same time, an apparently
dignified way of legitimizing what is above, below, and on either side.  It is
directed toward people and toward God.  It is a veil behind which human beings
can hide their own fallen existence, their trivialization, and their adaptation
to the status quo.  It is an excuse that everyone can use, from the greengrocer,
who conceals his fear of losing his job behind an alleged interest in the
unification of the workers of the world, to the highest functionary, whose
interest in staying in power can be cloaked in phrases about service to the
working class.  The primary excusatory function of ideology, therefore, is to
provide people, both as victims and pillars of the post-totalitarian system,
with the illusion that the system is in harmony with the human order and the

The smaller a dictatorship and the less stratified by modernization the society
under it, the more directly the will of the dictator can be exercised,  In other
words, the dictator can employ more or less naked discipline, avoiding the
complex processes of relating to the world and of self-justification which
ideology involves. But the more complex the mechanisms of power become, the
larger and more stratified the society they embrace, and the longer they have
operated historically, the more individuals must be connected to them from
outside, and the greater the importance attached to the ideological excuse.  It
acts as a kind of bridge between the regime and the people, across which the
regime approaches the people and the people approach the regime.  This explains
why ideology plays such an important role in the post-totalitarian system: that
complex machinery of units, hierarchies, transmission belts, and indirect
instruments of manipulation which ensure in countless ways the integrity of the
regime, leaving nothing to chance, would be quite simply unthinkable without
ideology acting as its all-embracing excuse and as the excuse for each of its

Between the aims of the post-totalitarian system and the aims of life there is a
yawning abyss: while life, in its essence, moves toward plurality, diversity,
independent self-constitution, and self organization, in short, toward the
fulfillment of its own freedom, the post-totalitarian system demands conformity,
uniformity, and discipline.  While life ever strives to create new and
improbable structures, the post-totalitarian system contrives to force life into
its most probable states. The aims of the system reveal its most essential
characteristic to be introversion, a movement toward being ever more completely
and unreservedly <em>itself</em>, which means that the radius of its influence
is continually widening as well.  This system serves people only to the extent
necessary to ensure that people will serve it.  Anything beyond this, that is to
say, anything which leads people to overstep their predetermined roles is
regarded by the system as an attack upon itself.  And in this respect it is
correct: every instance of such transgression is a genuine denial of the system.
It can be said, therefore, that the inner aim of the post-totalitarian system is
not mere preservation of power in the hands of a ruling clique, as appears to be
the case at first sight.  Rather, the social phenomenon of self-preservation is
subordinated to something higher, to a kind of blind automatism which drives the
system.  No matter what position individuals hold in the hierarchy of power,
they are not considered by the system to be worth anything in themselves, but
only as things intended to fuel and serve this automatism.  For this reason, an
individuals desire for power is admissible only in so far as its direction
coincides with the direction of the automatism of the system.

complete degradation of the individual is presented as his ultimate liberation;
depriving people of information is called making it available; the use of power
to manipulate is called the public control of power, and the arbitrary abuse of
power is called observing the legal code; the repression of culture is called
its development; the expansion of imperial influence is presented as support for
the oppressed; the lack of free expression becomes the highest form of freedom;
farcical elections become the highest form of democracy; banning independent
thought becomes the most scientific of world views; military occupation becomes
fraternal assistance.  Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must
falsify everything.  It falsifies the past.  It falsifies the present, and it
falsifies the future.  It falsifies statistics.  It pretends not to possess an

panorama and with some awareness of it, that is, against the background of the
panorama of which the greengrocer's shop window forms a part.  When the
greengrocer visits her office, he will not notice her slogan either, just as she
failed to notice his.  Nevertheless, their slogans are mutually dependent: both
were displayed with some awareness of the general panorama and, we might say,
under its <i>diktat</i>.  Both, however, assist in the creation of that
panorama, and therefore they assist in the creation of that <i>diktat</i> as
well.  The greengrocer and the office worker have both adapted to the conditions
in which they live, but in doing so, they help to create those conditions.  They
do what is done, what is to be done, what must be done, but at the same time
&mdash; by that very token &mdash; they confirm that it must be done in fact.
They conform to a particular requirement and in so doing they themselves
perpetuate that requirement.  Metaphysically speaking, without the greengrocer's
slogan the office workers slogan could not exist, and vice versa.  Each proposes
to the other that something be repeated and each accepts the others proposal.
Their mutual indifference to each others slogans is only an illusion: in
reality, by exhibiting their slogans, each compels the other to accept the rules
of the game and to confirm thereby the power that requires the slogans in the
first place.  Quite simply, each helps the other to be obedient.  Both are
objects in a system of control, but at the same time they are its subjects as

not the grayness and the emptiness of life in the post-totalitarian system only
an inflated caricature of modern life in general?  And do we not in fact stand

Let us now imagine that one day something in our greengrocer snaps and he stops
putting up the slogans merely to ingratiate himself.  He stops voting in
elections he knows are a farce.  He begins to say what he really thinks at
political meetings.  And he even finds the strength in himself to express
solidarity with those whom his conscience commands him to support.  In this
revolt the greengrocer steps out of living within the lie.  He rejects the
ritual and breaks the rules of the game.  He discovers once more his suppressed
identity and dignity. He gives his freedom a concrete significance. His revolt
is an attempt to <em>live within the truth</em>.

The bill is not long in coming. He will be relieved of his post as manager of
the shop and transferred to the warehouse.  His pay will be reduced.  His hopes
for a holiday in Bulgaria will evaporate.  His children's access to higher
education will be threatened.  His superiors will harass him and his fellow
workers will wonder about him.  Most of those who apply these sanctions,
however, will not do so from any authentic inner conviction but simply under
pressure from conditions, the same conditions that once pressured the
greengrocer to display the official slogans.  They will persecute the
greengrocer either because it is expected of them, or to demonstrate their
loyalty, or simply as part of the general panorama, to which belongs an
awareness that this is how situations of this sort are dealt with, that this, in
fact, is how things are always done, particularly if one is not to become
suspect oneself.  The executors, therefore, behave essentially like everyone
else, to a greater or lesser degree: as components of the post-totalitarian
system, as agents of its automatism, as petty instruments of the social
auto-totality.
]],
        par [[
Thus the power structure, through the agency of those who carry out the
sanctions, those anonymous components of the system, will spew the greengrocer
from its mouth.  The system, through its alienating presence in people, will
punish him for his rebellion.  It must do so because the logic of its automatism
and self-defense dictate it.  The greengrocer has not committed a simple,
individual offense, isolated in its own uniqueness, but something incomparably
more serious.  By breaking the rules of the game, he has disrupted the game as
such.  He has exposed it as a mere game.  He has shattered the world of
appearances, the fundamental pillar of the system.  He has upset the power
structure by tearing apart what holds it together.  He has demonstrated that
living a lie is living a lie. He has broken through the exalted facade of the
system and exposed the real, base foundations of power.  He has said that the
emperor is naked.  And because the emperor is in fact naked, something extremely
dangerous has happened: by his action, the greengrocer has addressed the world.
He has enabled everyone to peer behind the curtain.  He has shown everyone that
it is possible to live within the truth.  Living within the lie can constitute
the system only if it is universal.  The principle must embrace and permeate
everything.  There are no terms whatsoever on which it can co-exist with living
within the truth, and therefore everyone who steps out of line <em>denies it in
principle and threatens it in its entirety</em>.
]],
        par [[
This is understandable: as long as appearance is not confronted with reality, it
does not seem to be appearance.  As long as living a lie is not confronted with
living the truth, the perspective needed to expose its mendacity is lacking.  As
soon as the alternative appears, however, it threatens the very existence of
appearance and living a lie in terms of what they are, both their essence and
their all-inclusiveness.  And at the same time, it is utterly unimportant how
large a space this alternative occupies: its power does not consist in its
physical attributes but in the light it casts on those pillars of the system and
on its unstable foundations.  After all, the greengrocer was a threat to the
system not because of any physical or actual power he had, but because his
action went beyond itself, because it illuminated its surroundings and, of
course, because of the incalculable consequences of that illumination.  In the
post-totalitarian system, therefore, living within the truth has more than a
mere existential dimension (returning humanity to its inherent nature), or a
noetic dimension (revealing reality as it is), or a moral dimension (setting an
example for others).  It also has an unambiguous <em>political</em> dimension.
If the main pillar of the system is living a lie, then it is not surprising that
the fundamental threat to it is living the truth.  This is why it must be
suppressed more severely than anything else.

Individuals can be alienated from themselves only because there is

living a lie is an inauthentic response.  Only against this background does
living a lie make any sense: it exists <em>because</em> of that background.  In
its excusatory, chimerical rootedness in the human order, it is a response to
nothing other than the human predisposition to truth.  Under the orderly surface
of the life of lies, therefore, there slumbers the hidden sphere of life in its
real aims, of its hidden openness to truth.

The singular, explosive, incalculable political power of living within the truth
resides in the fact that living openly within the truth has an ally, invisible

life lived openly in the truth grows; it is to this sphere that it speaks, and
in it that it finds understanding.  This is where the potential for
communication exists.  But this place is hidden and therefore, from the
perspective of power, very dangerous.  The complex ferment that takes place
within it goes on in semidarkness, and by the time it finally surfaces into the
light of day as an assortment of shocking surprises to the system, it is usually
too late to cover them up in the usual fashion.  Thus they create a situation in
which the regime is confounded, invariably causing panic and driving it to react
in inappropriate ways.

        par [[
It seems that the primary breeding ground for what might, in the widest possible
sense of the word, be understood as an opposition in the post-totalitarian
system is living within the truth.  The confrontation between these opposition
forces and the powers that be, of course, will obviously take a form essentially
different from that typical of an open society or a classical dictatorship.
Initially, this confrontation does not take place on the level of real,
institutionalized, quantifiable power which relies on the various instruments of
power, but on a different level altogether: the level of human consciousness and
conscience, the existential level.  The effective range of this special power
cannot be measured in terms of disciples, voters, or soldiers, because it lies
spread out in the fifth column of social consciousness, in the hidden aims of
life, in human beings repressed longing for dignity and fundamental rights, for
the realization of their real social and political interests.  Its power,
therefore, does not reside in the strength of definable political or social
groups, but chiefly in the strength of a potential, which is hidden throughout
the whole of society, including the official power structures of that society.
Therefore this power does not.rely on soldiers of its own, but on the soldiers
of the enemy as it were --- that is to say, on everyone who is living within the
lie and who may be struck at any moment (in theory, at least) by the force of
truth (or who, out of an instinctive desire to protect their position, may at
least adapt to that force).  It is a bacteriological weapon, so to speak,
utilized when conditions are ripe by a single civilian to disarm an entire
division. This power does not participate in any direct struggle for power;
rather, it makes its influence felt in the obscure arena of being itself.  The
hidden movements it gives rise to there, however, can issue forth (when, where,
under what circumstances, and to what extent are difficult to predict) in
something visible: a real political act or event, a social movement, a sudden
explosion of civil unrest, a sharp conflict inside an apparently monolithic
power structure, or simply an irrepressible transformation in the social and
intellectual climate.  And since all genuine problems and matters of critical
importance are hidden beneath a thick crust of lies, it is never quite clear
when the proverbial last straw will fall, or what that straw will be.  This,
too, is why the regime prosecutes, almost as a reflex action preventively, even
the most modest attempts to live within the truth.

political debacles unpredictable in their consequences.  And so the
post-totalitarian system behaved in a characteristic way: it defended the

The profound crisis of human identity brought on by living within a lie, a

identity is dissolved in an amalgam of the accouterments of mass civilization,
and who has no roots in the order of being, no sense of responsibility for

Living within the truth, as humanity's revolt against an enforced position, is,
on the contrary, an attempt to regain control over one's own sense of
responsibility.  In other words, it is clearly a moral act, not only because one

risk may bring rewards in the form of a general amelioration in the situation,
or it may not.  In this regard, as I stated previously, it is an all-or-nothing
gamble, and it is difficult to imagine a reasonable person embarking on such a
course merely because he reckons that sacrifice today will bring rewards
tomorrow, be it only in the form of general gratitude.  (By the way, the
representatives of power invariably come to terms with those who live within the
truth by persistently ascribing utilitarian motivations to them &mdash; a lust
for power or fame or wealth &mdash; and thus they try, at least, to implicate
    them in their own world, the world of general demoralization.)

If living within the truth in the post-totalitarian system becomes the chief
breeding ground for independent, alternative political ideas, then all
considerations about the nature and future prospects of these ideas must
necessarily reflect this moral dimension as a political phenomenon.  (And if the
revolutionary Marxist belief about morality as a product of the "superstructure"
inhibits any of our friends from realizing the full significance of this
dimension and, in one way or another, from including it in their view of the
world, it is to their own detriment: an anxious fidelity to the postulates of
that world view prevents them from properly understanding the mechanisms of
their own political influence, thus paradoxically making them precisely what
they, as Marxists, so often suspect others of being &mdash; victims of "false
consciousness".)  The very special political significance of morality in the
post-totalitarian system is a phenomenon that is at the very least unusual in
modern political history, a phenomenon that might well have &mdash; as I shall

At the time when the Czech lands and Slovakia were an integral part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, and when there existed neither the historical nor the
political, psychological, nor social conditions that would have enabled the
Czechs and Slovaks to seek their identity outside the framework of this empire,
Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk established a Czechoslovak national program based on the
notion of "small-scale work" (<i>drobná prace</i>).  By that he meant honest and
responsible work in widely different areas of life but within the existing
social order, work that would stimulate national creativity and national
self-confidence.  Naturally he placed particular emphasis on intelligent and
enlightened upbringing and education, and on the moral and humanitarian aspects
of life.  Masaryk believed that the only possible starting point for a more
dignified national destiny was humanity itself.  Humanity's first task was to
create the conditions for a more human life; and in Masaryk's view, the task of
transforming the stature of the nation began with the transformation of human
beings.

and, in some areas at least, can point to indisputable achievements.  It is hard
to say how much worse things would be if there were not many hard-working people
who simply refuse to give up and try constantly to do the best they can, paying
an unavoidable minimum to living within a lie so that they might give their
utmost to the authentic needs of society.  These people assume, correctly, that
every piece of good work is an indirect criticism of bad politics, and that
there are situations where it is worthwhile going this route, even though it
means surrendering one's natural right to make direct criticisms.

in every way to thwart his efforts to do a good job.  Eventually the situation
became so bad that Š felt compelled to write a lengthy letter to the managers

explained why it was the worst in the district and pointed to those responsible.

otherwise ignorant of beer, a man who loathed workers and was given to intrigue,

perfect example of small-scale work in action.  Unfortunately, the precise
opposite occurred: the manager of the brewery, who was a member of the Communist
Party’s district committee, had friends in higher places and he saw to it that
the situation was resolved in his favor.  Š's analysis was described as a
"defamatory document" and Š himself was labeled a "political saboteur".  He was
thrown out of the brewery and shifted to another one where he was given a job
requiring no skill.  Here the notion of small-scale work had come up against the
wall of the post-totalitarian system.  By speaking the truth, Š had stepped out
of line, broken the rules, cast himself out, and he ended up as a sub-citizen,
stigmatized as an enemy.  He could now say anything he wanted, but he could

If what I have called living within the truth is a basic existential (and of
course potentially political) starting point for all those "independent citizens

every attempt to live within the truth automatically belongs in this category.
On the contrary, in its most original and broadest sense, living within the
truth covers a vast territory whose outer limits are vague and difficult to map,
a territory full of modest expressions of human volition, the vast majority of
which will remain anonymous and whose political impact will probably never be
felt or described any more concretely than simply as a part of a social climate
or mood.  Most of these expressions remain elementary revolts against
manipulation: you simply straighten your backbone and live in greater dignity as
an individual.

Here and there &mdash; thanks to the nature, the assumptions, and the
professions of some people, but also thanks to a number of accidental
circumstances such as the specific nature of the local milieu, friends, and so
on &mdash; a more coherent and visible initiative may emerge from this wide and
anonymous hinterland, an initiative that transcends "merely" individual revolt
and is transformed into more conscious, structured, and purposeful work.  The
point where living within the truth ceases to be a mere negation of living with
a lie and becomes articulate in a particular way is the point at which something
is born that might be called the "independent spiritual, social, and political
life of society".  This independent life is not separated from the rest of life
("dependent life") by some sharply defined line.  Both types frequently co-exist
in the same people.  Nevertheless, its most important focus is marked by a
relatively high degree of inner emancipation.  It sails upon the vast ocean of
the manipulated life like little boats, tossed by the waves but always bobbing
back as visible messengers of living within the truth, articulating the
suppressed aims of life.
]],
        par [[
What is this independent life of society?  The spectrum of its expressions and
activities is naturally very wide. It includes everything from self education
and thinking about the world, through free creative activity and its
communication to others, to the most varied free, civic attitudes, including
instances of independent social self-organization.  In short, it is an area in
which living within the truth becomes articulate and materializes in a visible
way.  Thus what will later be referred to as "citizens initiatives", "dissident
movements", or even "oppositions", emerge, like the proverbial one tenth of the
iceberg visible above the water, from that area, from the independent life of
society.  In other words, just as the independent life of society develops out
of living within the truth in the widest sense of the word, as the distinct,
articulated expression of that life, so "dissent" gradually emerges from the
independent life of society.  Yet there is a marked difference: if the
independent life of society, externally at least, can be understood as a higher
form of living within the truth, it is far less certain that "dissident"
movements are necessarily a higher form of the independent life of society.
They are simply one manifestation of it and, though they may be the most visible
and, at first glance, the most political (and most clearly articulated)
expression of it, they are far from necessarily being the most mature or even
the most important, not only in the general social sense but even in terms of
direct political influence.  After all, "dissent" has been artificially removed
from its place of birth by having been given a special name.  In fact, however,
it is not possible to think of it separated from the whole background out of
which it develops, of which it is an integral part, and from which it draws all
its vital strength.  In any case, it follows from what has already been said
about the peculiarities of the post-totalitarian system that what
<em>appears</em> to be the most political of forces in a given moment, and what
thinks of itself in such terms, need not necessarily in fact <em>be</em> such a
force.  The extent to which it is a real political force is due exclusively to
its pre-political context.
]],

What follows from this description?  Nothing more and nothing less than this: it
is impossible to talk about what in fact ``dissidents'' do and the effect of
their work without first talking about the work of all those who, in one way or
an other, take part in the independent life of society and who are not
necessarily "dissidents" at all.  They may be writers who write as they wish
without regard for censorship or official demands and who issue their work
&mdash; when official publishers refuse to print it &mdash; as <i>samizdat</i>.
They may be philosophers, historians, sociologists, and all those who practice
independent scholarship and, if it is impossible through official or
semi-official channels, who also circulate their work in <i>samizdat</i> or who
organize private discussions, lectures, and seminars.  They may be teachers who
privately teach young people things that are kept from them in the state
schools; clergymen who either in office or, if they are deprived of their
charges, outside it, try to carry on a free religious life; painters, musicians,
and singers who practice their work regardless of how it is looked upon by
official institutions; everyone who shares this independent culture and helps to
spread it; people who, using the means available to them, try to express and
defend the actual social interests of workers, to put real meaning back into
trade unions or to form independent ones; people who are not afraid to call the
attention of officials to cases of injustice and who strive to see that the laws
are observed; and the different groups of young people who try to extricate
themselves from manipulation and live in their own way, in the spirit of their
own hierarchy of values.  The list could go on.

Very few would think of calling all these people "dissidents".  And yet are not
the well-known "dissidents" simply people like them?  Are not all these
activities in fact what "dissidents" do as well?  Do they not produce scholarly
work and publish it in <i>samizdat</i>?  Do they not write plays and novels and
poems?  Do they not lecture to students in private "universities"?  Do they not
struggle against various forms of injustice and attempt to ascertain and express
the genuine social interests of various sectors of the population?  After having
tried to indicate the sources, the inner structure, and some aspects of the
"dissident" attitude as such, I have clearly shifted my viewpoint from outside,
as it were, to an investigation of what these "dissidents" <em>actually</em> do,
how their initiatives are manifested, and where they lead.

The first conclusion to be drawn, then, is that the original and most important
sphere of activity, one that predetermines all the others, is simply an attempt
to create and support the independent life of society as an articulated
expression of living within the truth.  In other words, serving truth
consistently, purposefully, and articulately, and organizing this service.  This
is only natural, after all: if living within the truth is an elementary starting
point for every attempt made by people to oppose the alienating pressure of the
system, if it is the only meaningful basis of any independent act of political
import, and if, ultimately, it is also the most intrinsic existential source of
the "dissident" attitude, then it is difficult to imagine that even manifest
"dissent" could have any other basis than the service of truth, the truthful
life, and the attempt to make room for the genuine aims of life.

pleasing illusion that justice is done, society protected, and the exercise of
power objectively regulated.  All this is done to conceal the real essence of
post-totalitarian legal practice: the total manipulation of society.  If an
outside observer who knew nothing at all about life in Czechoslovakia were to
study only its laws, he would be utterly incapable of understanding what we were
complaining about.  The hidden political manipulation of the courts and of
public prosecutors, the limitations placed on lawyers ability to defend their
clients, the closed nature, <i>de facto</i>, of trials, the arbitrary actions of
the security forces, their position of authority over the judiciary, the
absurdly broad application of several deliberately vague sections of that code,
and of course the states utter disregard for the positive sections of that code
(the rights of citizens): all of this would remain hidden from our outside
observer.  The only thing he would take away would be the impression that our
legal code is not much worse than the legal code of other civilized countries,
and not much different either, except perhaps for certain curiosities, such as
the entrenchment in the constitution of a single political party's eternal rule
and the states love for a neighboring superpower.  But that is not all: if our
observer had the opportunity to study the formal side of the policing and
judicial procedures and practices, how they look "on paper", he would discover
that for the most part the common rules of criminal procedure are observed:
charges are laid within the prescribed period following arrest, and it is the
same with detention orders.  Indictments are properly delivered, the accused has
a lawyer, and so on.  In other words, everyone has an excuse: <i>they have all
observed the law</i>.  In reality, however, they have cruelly and pointlessly
ruined a young persons life, perhaps for no other reason than because he made
<i>samizdat</i> copies of a novel written by a banned writer, or because the
police deliberately falsified their testimony (as everyone knows, from the judge
on down to the defendant).  Yet all of this somehow remains in the background.
The falsified testimony is not necessarily obvious from the trial documents and
the section of the Criminal Code dealing with incitement does not formally
exclude the application of that charge to the copying of a banned novel.  In
other words, the legal code &mdash; at least in several areas &mdash; is no more
than a facade, an aspect of the world of appearances.  Then why is it there at
all?  For exactly the same reason as ideology is there: it provides a bridge of
excuses between the system and individuals, making it easier for them to enter
the power structure and serve the arbitrary deceives history itself.

a job for people and not for laws and institutions.  It is possible to imagine a
society with good laws that are fully respected but in which it is impossible to
live.  Conversely, one can imagine life being quite bearable even where the laws
are imperfect and imperfectly applied.  The most important thing is always the
quality of that life and whether or not the laws enhance life or repress it, not
merely whether they are upheld or not.  (Often strict observance of the law
could have a disastrous impact on human dignity.)  The key to a humane,
dignified, rich, and happy life does not lie either in the constitution or in
the Criminal Code.  These merely establish what may or may not be done and,
thus, they can make life easier or more difficult.  They limit or permit, they
punish, tolerate, or defend, but they can never give life substance or meaning.
The struggle for what is called "legality" must constantly keep this legality in
perspective against the background of life as it really is.  Without keeping
one's eyes open to the real dimensions of life's beauty and misery, and without
a moral relationship to life, this struggle will sooner or later come to grief
on the rocks of some self-justifying system of scholastics.  Without really
wanting to, one would thus become more and more like the observer who comes to
conclusions about our system only on the basis of trial documents and is
satisfied if all the appropriate regulations have been observed.

Is the basic job of the "dissident" movements is to serve truth, that is, to
serve the real aims of life, and if that necessarily develops into a defense of
individuals and their right to a free and truthful life (that is, a defense of
human rights and a struggle to see the laws respected), then another stage of
this approach, perhaps the most mature stage so far, is what Václav Benda called
the development of "parallel structures".
]],
        par [[
When those who have decided to live within the truth have been denied any direct
influence on the existing social structures, not to mention the opportunity to
participate in them, and when these people begin to create what I have called
the independent life of society, this independent life begins, of itself, to
become structured in a certain way.  Sometimes there are only very embryonic
indications of this process of structuring; at other times, the structures are
already quite well developed.  Their genesis and evolution are inseparable from
the phenomenon of "dissent", even though they reach far beyond the arbitrarily
defined area of activity usually indicated by that term.
]],
        par [[
What are these structures? Ivan Jirous was the first in Czechoslovakia to
formulate and apply in practice the concept of a "second culture".  Although at
first he was thinking chiefly of nonconformist rock music and only certain
literary, artistic, or performance events close to the sensibilities of those
nonconformist musical groups, the term second culture very rapidly came to be
used for the whole area of independent and repressed culture, that is, not only
for art and its various currents but also for the humanities, the social
sciences, and philosophical thought.  This second culture, quite naturally, has
created elementary organizational forms: <i>samizdat</i> editions of books and
magazines, private performances and concerts, seminars, exhibitions, and so on.
(In Poland all of this is vastly more developed: there are independent
publishing houses and many more periodicals, even political periodicals; they
have means of proliferation other than carbon copies, and so on.  In the Soviet
Union, <i>samizdat</i> has a longer tradition and clearly its forms are quite
different.)  Culture, therefore, is a sphere in which the parallel structures
can be observed in their most highly developed form. Benda, of course, gives
thought to potential or embryonic forms.of such structures in other spheres as
well: from a parallel information network to parallel forms of education
(private universities), parallel trade unions, parallel foreign contacts, to a
kind of hypothesis on a parallel economy. On the basis of these parallel
structures, he then develops the notion of a "parallel <i>polis</i>" or state
or, rather, he sees the rudiments of such a <i>polis</i> in these structures.
]],
        par [[
At a certain stage in its development, the independent life of society and the
"dissident" movements cannot avoid a certain amount of organization and
institutionalization.  This is a natural development, and unless this
independent life of society is somehow radically suppressed and eliminated, the
tendency will grow.  Along with it, a parallel political life will also
necessarily evolve, and to a certain extent it exists already in Czechoslovakia.
Various groupings of a more or less political nature will continue to define
themselves politically, to act and confront each other.  These parallel
structures, it may be said, represent the most articulated expressions so far of
living within the truth.  One of the most important tasks the "dissident"
movements have set themselves is to support and develop them.  Once again, it
confirms the fact that all attempts by society to resist the pressure of the
system have their essential beginnings in the "pre-political" area.  For what
else are parallel structures than an area where a different life can be lived, a
life that is in harmony with its own aims and which in turn structures itself in
harmony with those aims?  What else are those initial attempts at social self
organization than the efforts of a certain part of society to live &mdash; as a
society &mdash; within the truth, to rid itself of the self-sustaining aspects
of totalitarianism and, thus, to extricate itself radically from its involvement
in the post-totalitarian system?  What else is it but a nonviolent attempt by
people to negate the system within themselves and to establish their lives on a
new basis, that of their own proper identity?  And does this tendency not
confirm once more the principle of returning the focus to actual individuals?
After all, the parallel structures do not grow <i>a priori</i> out of a
theoretical vision of systemic changes (there are no political sects involved),
but from the aims of life and the authentic needs of real people.  In fact, all
eventual changes in the system, changes we may observe here in their rudimentary
forms, have come about as it were <i>de facto</i>, from "below", because life
compelled them to, not because they came before life, somehow directing it or
forcing some change on it.

        par [[
Historical experience teaches us that any genuinely meaningful point of
departure in an individuals life usually has an element of universality about
it.  In other words, it is not something partial, accessible only to a
restricted community, and not transferable to any other.  On the contrary, it
must be potentially accessible to everyone; it must foreshadow a general
solution and, thus, it is not just the expression of an introverted,
self-contained responsibility that individuals have to and for themselves alone,
but responsibility to and for the <em>world</em>.  Thus it would be quite wrong
to understand the parallel structures and the parallel <i>polis</i> as a retreat
into a ghetto and as an act of isolation, addressing itself only to the welfare
of those who had decided on such a course, and who are indifferent to the rest.
It would be wrong, in short, to consider it an essentially group solution that
has nothing to do with the general situation.  Such a concept would, from the
start, alienate the notion of living within the truth from its proper point of
departure, which is concern for others, transforming it ultimately into just
another more sophisticated version of living within a lie.  In doing so, of
course, it would cease to be a genuine point of departure for individuals and
groups and would recall the false notion of "dissidents" as an exclusive group
with exclusive interests, carrying on their own exclusive dialogue with the
powers that be.  In any case, even the most highly developed forms of life in
the parallel structures, even that most mature form of the parallel <i>polis</i>
can only exist &mdash; at least in post-totalitarian circumstances &mdash; when
the individual is at the same time lodged in the "first", official structure by
a thousand different relationships, even though it may only be the fact that one
buys what one needs in their stores, uses their money, and obeys their laws.
Certainly one can imagine life in its baser aspects flourishing in the parallel
<i>polis</i>, but would not such a life, lived deliberately that way, as a
program, be merely another version of the schizophrenic life within a lie which
everyone else must live in one way or another?  Would it not just be further
evidence that a point of departure that is not a model solution, that is not
applicable to others, cannot be meaningful for an individual either?  Patočka
used to say that the most interesting thing about responsibility is that we
carry it with us everywhere.  That means that responsibility is ours, that we
must accept it and grasp it <em>here</em>, <em>now</em>, in this place in time
and space where the Lord has set us down, and that we cannot lie our way out of
it by moving somewhere else, whether it be to an Indian ashram or to a parallel
<i>podis</i>.  If Western young people so often discover that retreat to an
Indian monastery fails them as an individual or group solution, then this is
obviously because, and only because, it lacks that element of universality,
since not everyone can retire to an ashram.  Christianity is an example of an
opposite way out: it is a point of departure for me here and now &mdash; but
only because anyone, anywhere, at any time, may avail themselves of it.  In
other words, the parallel <i>polis</i> points beyond itself and makes sense only
as an act of deepening one's responsibility to and for the whole, as a way of
discovering the most appropriate locus for this responsibility, not as an escape
from it.

The primary purpose of the outward direction of these movements is always, as we
have seen, to have an impact on society, not to affect the power structure, at
least not directly and immediately.  Independent initiatives address the hidden
sphere; they demonstrate that living within the truth is a human and social
alternative and they struggle to expand the space available for that life; they
help &mdash; even though it is, of course, indirect help &mdash; to raise the
confidence of citizens; they shatter the world of appearances and unmask the
real nature of power.  They do not assume a messianic role; they are not a
social avant-garde or elite that alone knows best, and whose task it is to
"raise the consciousness" of the "unconscious" masses (that arrogant
self-projection is, once again, intrinsic to an essentially different way of
thinking, the kind that feels it has a patent on some ideal project and
therefore that it has the right to impose it on society).  Nor do they want to
lead anyone.  They leave it up to each individual to decide what he will or will
not take from their experience and work.  (If official Czechoslovak propaganda
described the Chartists as "self-appointees", it was not in order to emphasize
any real avant-garde ambitions on their part, but rather a natural expression of
how the regime thinks, its tendency to judge others according to itself, since
behind any expression of criticism it automatically sees the desire to cast the
mighty from their seats and rule in their places "in the name of the people",
the same pretext the regime itself has used for years.)

I have already indicated one of the ways this can work: an awareness of the laws
and the responsibility for seeing that they are upheld is indirectly
strengthened.  That, of course, is only a specific instance of a far broader

created by free thought, alternative values and alternative behavior, and by
independent social self-realization.

The specific nature of post-totalitarian conditions &mdash; with their absence
of a normal political life and the fact that any far-reaching political change
is utterly unforeseeable &mdash; has one positive aspect: it compels us to
examine our situation in terms of its deeper coherences and to consider our
future in the context of global, long-range prospects of the world of which we
are a part.  The fact that the most intrinsic and fundamental confrontation
between human beings and the system takes place at a level incomparably more
profound than that of traditional politics would seem, at the same time, to
determine as well the direction such considerations will take.

Our attention, therefore, inevitably turns to the most essential matter: the
crisis of contemporary technological society as a whole, the crisis that
Heidegger describes as the ineptitude of humanity face to face with the
planetary power of technology.  Technology &mdash; that child of modern science,
which in turn is a child of modern metaphysics &mdash; is out of humanity's
control, has ceased to serve us, has enslaved us and compelled us to participate
in the preparation of our own destruction.  And humanity can find no way out: we
have no idea and no faith, and even less do we have a political conception to
help us bring things back under human control.  We look on helplessly as that
coldly functioning machine we have created inevitably engulfs us, tearing us
away from our natural affiliations (for instance, from our habitat in the widest
sense of that word, including our habitat in the biosphere) just as it removes
us from the experience of "being" and casts us into the world of "existences".

"Only a God can save us now", Heidegger says, and he emphasizes the necessity of
"a different way of thinking", that is, of a departure from what philosophy has

all he can recommend is "preparing expectations".

Various thinkers and movements feel that this as yet unknown way out might be
most generally characterized as a broad "existential revolution".  I share this
view, and I also share the opinion that a solution cannot be sought in some
technological sleight of hand, that is, in some external proposal for change, or
in a revolution that is merely philosophical, merely social, merely
technological, or even merely political.  These are all areas where the
consequences of an existential revolution can and must be felt; but their most
intrinsic locus can only be human existence in the profoundest sense of the
word.  It is only from that basis that it can become a generally ethical &mdash;
and, of course, ultimately a political &mdash; reconstitution of society.

What we call the consumer and industrial (or postindustrial) society, and Ortega
y Gasset once understood as "the revolt of the masses", as well as the
intellectual, moral, political, and social misery in the world today: all of
this is perhaps merely an aspect of the deep crisis in which humanity, dragged
helplessly along by the automatism of global technological civilization, finds
itself.  The post-totalitarian system is only one aspect &mdash; a particularly
drastic aspect and thus all the more revealing of its real origins &mdash; of
this general inability of modern humanity to be the master of its own situation.
The automatism of the post-totalitarian system is merely an extreme version of
the global automatism of technological civilization.  The human failure that it
mirrors is only one variant of the general failure of modern humanity.

This planetary challenge to the position of human beings in the world is, of
course, also taking place in the Western world, the only difference being the
social and political forms it takes.  Heidegger refers expressly to a crisis of
democracy.  There is no real evidence that Western democracy, that is, democracy
of the traditional parliamentary type, can offer solutions that are any more
profound.  It may even be said that the more room there is in the Western
democracies (compared to our world) for the genuine aims of life, the better the
crisis is hidden from people and the more deeply do they become immersed in it.

It would appear that the traditional parliamentary democracies can offer no
fundamental opposition to the automatism of technological civilization and the
industrial-consumer society, for they, too, are being dragged helplessly along
by it.  People are manipulated in ways that are infinitely more subtle and
refined than the brutal methods used in the post-totalitarian societies.  But
this static complex of rigid, conceptually sloppy, and politically pragmatic
mass political parties run by professional apparatuses and releasing the citizen
from all forms of concrete and personal responsibility; and those complex
focuses of capital accumulation engaged in secret manipulations and expansion;
the omnipresent dictatorship of consumption, production, advertising, commerce,
consumer culture, and all that flood of information: all of it, so often
analyzed and described, can only with great difficulty be imagined as the source
of humanity's rediscovery of itself.  In his June 1978 Harvard lecture,
Solzhenitsyn describes the illusory nature of freedoms not based on personal
responsibility and the chronic inability of the traditional democracies, as a
result, to oppose violence and totalitarianism.  In a democracy, human beings
may enjoy many .personal freedoms and securities that are unknown to us, but in
the end they do them no good, for they too are ultimately victims of the same
automatism, and are incapable of defending their concerns about their own
identity or preventing their superficialization or transcending concerns about
their own personal survival to become proud and responsible members of the
<i>polis</i>, making a genuine contribution to the creation of its destiny.

Because all our prospects for a significant change for the better are very long
range indeed, we are obliged to take note of this deep crisis of traditional
democracy.  Certainly, if conditions were to be created for democracy in some
countries in the Soviet bloc (although this is becoming increasingly
improbable), it might be an appropriate transitional solution that would help to
restore the devastated premise of civic awareness, to renew democratic
discussion, to allow for the crystallization of an elementary political
plurality, an essential expression of the aims of life.  But to cling to the
notion of traditional parliamentary democracy as one's political ideal and to
succumb to the illusion that only this tried and true form is capable of
guaranteeing human beings enduring dignity and an independent role in society
would, in my opinion, be at the very least shortsighted.

I see a renewed focus of politics on real people as something far more profound
than merely returning to the everyday mechanisms of Western (or, if you like,
bourgeois) democracy.  In 1968, I felt that our problem could be solved by
forming an opposition party that would compete publicly for power with the
Communist Party.  I have long since come to realize, however, that it is just
not that simple and that no opposition party in and of itself,just as no new
electoral laws in and of themselves, could make society proof against some new
form of violence.  No "dry" organizational measures in themselves can provide
that guarantee, and we would be hard-pressed to find in them that God who alone
can save us.
