The latest revision of the mandatory reading series for C++ programmers.  Each
new revision of the language (a steady process every three years now, since
C++11) has introduced powerful and expressive constructs, always building on top
of previous ones.  The <i>Effective</i> series presents these new concepts in a
pragmatic way with copious code examples and is considered a reference for best
practices and guidelines among C++ programmers.
