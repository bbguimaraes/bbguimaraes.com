A detailed introduction to programming for heterogeneous devices, this book
presents the OpenCL language along with its C API.  Additionally, each component
is contextualized with discussions of traditional architectures for CPUs,
GPUs, FPGAs, and other devices and several case studies, with accompanying
source code examples.
