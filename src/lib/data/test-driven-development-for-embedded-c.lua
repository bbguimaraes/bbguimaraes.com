A very good introduction to Test Driven Development with an emphasis on systems
programming for embedded devices.  Always in a very practical manner, sample
programs of progressive complexity &mdash; from simple unit tests to black-box
integration tests involving several components &mdash; are presented along with
techniques to address the challenges inherent in designing software for
constrained hardware platforms.
