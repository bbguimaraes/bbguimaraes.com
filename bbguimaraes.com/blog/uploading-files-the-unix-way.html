I just did something which I thought was worth sharing.  It shows a couple of
fundamental techniques in unix systems used in a context where most people
would not think of.
            </p><p>
The context: my mom sent me a recipe of potato souffle (I hope google translate
is doing the right thing here,
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=potato+souffle"> it seems like it
    is</a>).  But as most of e-mails coming from non-tech people, there was a
lot of noise along the actual recipe text.  Since I wanted to view it in my
cell phone while I cooked, I decided to clean it up a bit.
            </p><p>
So did I: copied the text to vim (which got rid of most of the noise
immediately), edited a bit and it was ready:
            </p>
            <pre>

Now all I needed was a way to get it on my cellphone.  I could use dropbox or
any of the related services, but that didn't seem exciting
enough[<a href="#note1">1</a>].  So I thought: well, I'll just put it in my
webserver and access it in my mobile browser.
            </p><p>
Fair enough.  But this is a file opened in vim[<a href="#note2">2</a>].  After
a little thinking (which lasted for approximately 423ms), this is what I did.
From inside vim, I executed the following command:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
:!ssh raspberrypi 'nc -l 31415 > /srv/http/sufle.txt' &
</pre>
            </code>
            <p>
Which launched an ssh client connecting to my webserver[<a href="#note3">3</a>]
running the netcat command.  If you are not familiar with netcat, think of it
as the traditional cat command which reads and writes to sockets instead of
files.  Here, I'm telling it to listen (<i>-l</i>) on port 31415 and output
anything read to the file <i>/srv/http/sufle.txt</i>, where <i>/srv/http</i> is
the document root of the webserver.
            </p><p>
Since I added the ampersand to the end of the command, the command is launched
in the background and just stays there waiting for input, releasing the shell
immediately so I can continue using vim.  Now that we're back, another vim
command:
            </p>
            <code><pre>:w !cat > /dev/tcp/raspberrypi/31415</pre></code>
            <p>
Here we are telling vim to write the contents of the buffer (<i>:w</i>).
Normally, we would give it the name of a file to write, but the <i>:write</i>
command accepts a special syntax, where instead of a file name, we put a
<i>!</i> and the rest of the line is interpreted as a
command[<a href="#note4">4</a>].  This command is executed in a standard unix
shell, but with stdin redirected to read the contents of the buffer. As an
example, try opening a new empty buffer in vim (<i>c-w n</i>), writing
something and executing the command[<a href="#note5">5</a>]:
            </p>
            <code><pre>:w !cowsay</pre></code>
            <p>
Continuing the analysis of the command, we are using the <i>:w !</i> command to
write to the program run by the shell, which is
            </p>
            <code><pre>$ cat > /dev/tcp/raspberrypi/31415</pre></code>
            <p>
Well, you don't need to be a unix wizard to know what this is doing. cat is a
command that reads the contents from a list of files (or stdin if it's invoked
without arguments, as it is here) and writes them in the same order to its
stdout. Since its stdin will read the contents of the vim buffer, we already
know the effect of this command: the contents of the buffer will get written to
a file.
            </p><p>
But what is that funny file starting with <i>/dev/tcp/</i>? That is feature of
bash (I don't know about other shells). You can read about using the command[<a
href="#note6">6</a>]:
            </p>
            <code><pre>$ man -P 'less -p /dev/tcp' bash</pre></code>
            <p>
What we are doing here is telling bash to write the data coming from cat's
output to port 31415 on the host raspberrypi. Remember our little ssh friend we
left running in the background a while ago? It hasn't done much
since[<a href="#note7">7</a>], but now there is data coming from the socket
it's listening on, so the os wakes him up to do its job.
            </p><p>
And so it does, reading the data from the socket and writing it to stdout.
Remember what that is?  That's the file we passed to the shell,
<i>/srv/http/sufle.txt</i>.  And so our long journey comes to an end.  When nc
finishes reading and writing the data, it dies[<a href="#note8">8</a>] and so
does the ssh client process, which was also sitting there, waiting for it's
child process to die[<a href="#note9">9</a>].  The shell that spawned the ssh
client has long died: it had nothing more to do because we started the process
asynchronously (using the <i>&</i> on the command line), so that's the end of
that (process) family tree[<a href="#note10">10</a>].
            </p><p>
The result? The contents of the buffer have now been transfered and written to
the file <i>/src/http/sufle.txt</i> on the remote host raspberrypi.
            </p>

            <p>
You might be thinking: "What the hell?  You are telling me all this is simpler
than dropbox?".  And I would be lying if I said "yes".  But the point here is
not that this is simple.  In fact, it's the base of one of the most complex
systems in computer history: the operating system.  And even though I have
detailed some parts of the processes, there are a lot, and I really mean *a
lot* more things going on behind the scenes here[<a href="#note11">11</a>].
            </p><p>
But if you step back, you will realize that all that was needed were two
commands:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
ssh raspberrypi 'nc -l 31415 > /srv/http/sufle.txt'
cat > /dev/tcp/raspberrypi/31415
</pre>
            </code>
            <p>
What I'm trying to present here is the incredible complexity and richness that
can be achieved by using shell commands and unix concepts like input and output
redirections and socket communication.  Another goal was to show how a powerful
text editor incorporates this concept in its design, taking advantage of of the
powerful features of the operating system to extend its
capabilities[<a href="#note12">12</a>].
            </p><p>
And I bet I can type these two commands faster than your dropbox client can
transfer the file to your cellphone[<a href="#note13">13</a>].  Now, I you'll
excuse me, there is a potato souffle that needs to be cooked.

While doing some scientific tests on the cowsay program (trying to make the cow
say the text of this post), I discovered perl has a special mention of my blog
on its source code[<a href="#note14">14</a>]:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
:w !cowsay
This shouldn't happen at /usr/share/perl5/core_perl/Text/Wrap.pm line 84, &lt;stdin&gt; line 63.
shell returned 255
</pre>

The space after <i>:w</i> is important here. If we wrote <i>:w!cat ...</i>, it
would be interpret as the <i>:write!</i> command, which is not what we want
here. See <i>:help :write!</i> on vim.

It hasn't been doing anything, actually, thanks to the magic of process

Including, for example, the whole file buffer cache algorithm that makes this
whole process absurdly efficient, even though we seem to be copying data around
dozens of times. That is the subject of whole book chapters (like
