Much has been written about the venerable
<a href="https://strace.io/"><code>strace</code></a>, one of the most important
allies of the systems programmer.  However, the focus is often on the specifics
of the particular program being examined, not on the functioning of
<code>strace</code> itself and the operating system environment involved in the
execution of the process.  Today we explore this neglected part of the system
call trace.
            </p>

            <p>
The first encounter with <code>strace</code> is very intimidating: even the most
apparently trivial programs are revealed to not be so under its dissection.
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ strace true |&amp; wc
     35     213    2485
$ strace ls /sys |&amp; wc
     81     453    5148</code></pre>
            <p>
For this reason, texts presenting techniques for analysis and debugging instruct
the reader to ignore the beginning of the output.  There are indeed a number of
steps involved in executing a fully-featured program built for modern operating
systems, but it need not be so.  Examples traditionally start with a
<code>printf</code>, but a minimal, much smaller and simpler executable can be
crafted which results in an almost empty trace.
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ as <a href="strace-prelude-in-c/min.s">min.s</a> -o min.o
$ ld --oformat binary min.o -o min
$ du --bytes min
124     min
$ env --ignore-environment strace ./min
execve("./min", ["./min"], 0x7ffec174db90 /* 0 vars */) = 0
exit(0)                                 = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++</code></pre>
            <p>
In fact, under <code>strace</code>, this is the smallest possible output for a
program that correctly terminates.  After the program is assembled, it is
executed under <code>env -i</code>/<code>--ignore-environment</code> so that all
environment variables from the shell are cleared, reducing the size and
variability of the output.  The first line of the trace is the
<code>execve(2)</code> which begins the execution of the program specified in
the command line.  Nelson Elhage's
<a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/2010/08/write-yourself-an-strace-in-70-lines-of-code/">article</a>
on building a minimal tracing tool using <code>ptrace(2)</code> has an excellent
explanation of the reason why this is always the first line, as well as the path
that gets there and much more.

The <code>min.s</code> file instructs the assembler to manually create an ELF
file.  This and all other files presented are built on and for an x86-64 Linux
machine.  They inevitably display platform-specific aspects, but the concepts
are still generally applicable.  The exact details of generating such a file
will not be covered: many resources on this subject can be found on the
internet.  Consult the source code and the <code>elf(5)</code> manual page.
                </p>
                <p>
The entirety of the instruction stream is encoded in four bytes in the binary:
                </p>

                <p>
This program simply sets up the <code>rax</code> register and issues a system
call.  <code>rax</code> receives the value <code>3c<sub>16</sub></code> /
<code>60<sub>10</sub></code>, which is the code for <code>sys_exit</code> on
x86-64.  <code>rdi</code>, implicitly set to zero, indicates the status code.
                </p>
                <p>
Depending on the version of <code>binutils</code>, it may be necessary to use
<code>as --mx86-used-note no</code> in order to generate an unadulterated object
file (or, alternatively, to remove that section post factum with <code>objcopy
--remove-section .note.gnu.property</code> before the linking step).

            <p>
To start moving to more complex examples, the previous program can be rewritten
in (partially non-standard and very low-level) C.  The entire purpose of the new
source code is to instruct the compiler to generate the same <code>_start</code>
entry point as expected by the (now implicitly invoked) assembler, with the
exact same machine code.

}</code></pre>
            <p>
When compiled as a static executable, this source code produces the same
sequence of instructions and an equivalent result when traced (it is also about
70x larger).

The <code>-nostdlib</code> flag is used to suppress the inclusion of the C
standard library facilities, since none of them are used in this program.  Even
though it is a very minimalistic language (compared to its more modern
counterparts), the C standard library manages a number of library and operating
system components, and much of the initialization of a process — prior to the
execution of the <code>main</code> function — is done by the library.
            </p>

            <p>
Somewhat unconventionally compared to other Unix descendants (and operating
systems in general), the C library is not strictly considered part of the
operating system on Linux.  As such, the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">GNU C library</a>
(<code>glibc</code>) is the traditional implementation used on most systems, but
a number of alternatives exist.
<a href="https://musl.libc.org/"><code>musl</code></a> is one of these
implementations.  Its focus on simplicity is appropriate to begin exploring the
C runtime.  Tracing the true C "hello, world" program compiled with
<code>musl</code> yields:
            </p>
            <pre><code><b>int</b> main(<b>void</b>) {}</code></pre>
            <pre><code>$ musl-gcc -std=c17 -static <a href="strace-prelude-in-c/libc.c">libc.c</a>

All changes in the output are related to the threading library and its runtime
setup:

                <li>
                    <p>
<code>arch_prctl(2)</code> is an x86-64 system call for managing thread
state; the <code>ARCH_SET_FS</code> operation manipulates the <code>FS</code>
register, used in the implementation of thread-local storage<a href="#note0"><sup>0</sup></a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
<code>set_tid_address(2)</code> is used in the <code>pthread(3)</code>
implementation.  The address passed to it corresponds to the
<code>child_tid</code> argument of <code>clone(2)</code> and is part of the
implementation of <code>pthread_create(3)</code>, <code>pthread_join(3)</code>,
etc.

Tracing the same program as before, but now compiled using the GNU standard
library, yields a much longer output, detailed in parts below.  All of the new
calls come from the standard library initialization, done by the
<code>__libc_start_main_impl</code> function (defined using the
<code>LIBC_START_MAIN</code> macro, for those following the code).
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ gcc -std=c17 -static -O2 <a href="strace-prelude-in-c/libc.c">libc.c</a>

            <p>
<code>arch_prctl(2)</code> is used here again, this time performing a mysterious
<code>0x3001</code> operation<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  This code
corresponds to the <code>ARCH_CET_STATUS</code> operation, used in the
implementation of Intel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity#Intel_Control-flow_Enforcement_Technology">Control-flow
Enforcement Technology</a>, in particular
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/885220/"><i>shadow stacks</i></a> and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/889475/"><i>indirect branch tracking</i></a>.
In this particular machine, the CPU does not support these features.
            </p>
            <pre><code>brk(NULL)                               = 0x232b000

            <p>
<code>brk(2)</code> controls the <i>program break</i>, i.e. the maximum address
of the program's heap.  The first call uses <code>NULL</code> to retrieve the
current value (n.b.: this is a Linux idiosyncrasy, POSIX <code>brk(2)</code>
returns <code>0</code> on success), while the second sets it to
<code>0xdc0</code> bytes above that value.  This is dynamic memory allocation at
its lowest level (above the kernel), virtually equivalent to
<code>malloc(0xdc0)</code>.  Here, it is done in the initialization of
thread-local storage.
            </p>
            <pre><code>arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_FS, 0x232b3c0)      = 0

set_robust_list(0x232b6a0, 24)          = 0</code></pre>
            <p>
Threading configuration is done similarly to <code>musl</code>.
<code>set_robust_list</code> is also related to threading: it ensures proper
handling of <code>futex(2)</code>es when threads terminate unexpectedly.
            </p>
            <pre><code>rseq(0x232bd60, 0x20, 0, 0x53053053)    = 0</code></pre>
            <p>
Restartable sequences are a kernel mechanism, recently incorporated
into <code>glibc</code>, which allow user space to use per-CPU data as is done
extensively in kernel mode.  This requires operating system support, since user
programs are constantly preempted, which is configured via this system call.
You know <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/883104/">where</a> to find more
information by now.

readlink("/proc/self/exe", "/home/bbguimaraes/src/bbguimarae"..., 4096) = 71</code></pre>
            <p>
These calls are relatively simple.  The antediluvian <code>uname(2)</code> is
used to retrieve the kernel version.  <code>prlimit64(2)</code> retrieves the
maximum stack size, to be used as the default <code>stacksize</code> attribute
in <code>pthread_create(3)</code>.  Finally, <code>readlink(2)</code> is used
with the Linux-specific <code>/proc/self/exe</code> symbolic link to discover
the path of the executable.

            <p>
Amusingly, this is the first time <code>malloc(3)</code> is called (recall the
program break was set directly using <code>brk(2)</code> before).  As part of
its internal initialization, a 64-bit value is set to a random value.  Then,
memory is allocated in the same way as before: by retrieving the current program
break and incrementing it (this is actually a library version of
<code>sbrk(2)</code> implemented using <code>brk(2)</code>).

To complete our investigation of the usual <code>strace</code> prelude, dynamic
linking is introduced.  Doing so generates many system calls performed by the
linker, which appear in the output since they occur as part of the
<code>execve(2)</code> call.  Somewhat surprisingly, it also changes
considerably the actions performed during <code>glibc</code>'s initialization.
Details on what is covered in this section can be found in the
<code>ld.so(8)</code> and <code>ldconfig(8)</code> manual pages.  Charng-Da Lu's
<a href="https://stevens.netmeister.org/631/elf.html">article</a> on the ELF
format also details some of the <code>glibc</code> linker implementation.
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ gcc -std=c17 -O2 <a href="strace-prelude-in-c/libc.c">libc.c</a>

arch_prctl(0x3001 /* ARCH_??? */, 0x7ffc92198690) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)</code></pre>
            <p>
The first few lines are familiar, except there is now a single direct call to
<code>brk(2)</code> to retrieve the current program break.

            <pre><code>access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)</code></pre>
            <p>
There are many ways to instruct the linker to load additional shared libraries
before beginning the execution of a dynamically-linked program.  The
<code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable is perhaps the best known of them,
but <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code> can also be used to affect every process in
the system.  This particular machine does not have this file.
            </p>

When <code>ldconfig(8)</code> sets up shared libraries in the system
directories, it also populates <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code>.  This file is
structured so that the shared library names registered in a dynamically-linked
program (<code>soname</code>s) can be searched quickly when its execution
begins.  The cache is a binary file: its contents can be viewed using
<code>ldconfig -p</code>/<code>--print-cache</code>.  During initialization, the
linker opens the file and <code>mmap(2)</code>s it into the process' address
space<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

Here dynamic linking per se begins.  The first library to be linked is naturally
the C standard library.  It is found via <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code> and
opened directly.  <code>read(2)</code> and <code>pread64(2)</code> (i.e. read
with offset) are used to determine the contents of the shared library.  Each
section is then <code>mmap(2)</code>ed into the process' address space with the

Another <code>malloc(3)</code> call causes more system memory to be requested
(corresponding to the initial <code>brk(2)</code> calls during TLS
initialization in the statically-linked program).  It is followed by a series of
familiar calls, only this time there are a few read-only memory sections (and
they are mapped to dynamic locations).

With the dynamic linking done, the cache is unmapped and our magnanimous
<code>main</code> function is executed.  This brings us to the end of a complete
<code>strace</code> output.

Of course, as a programmer or system administrator, it is <em>at this point</em>
that your job would begin in tracing the actual program under consideration, but
problems sometimes occur in or are caused by the library and operating system
components described here.  Understanding these concepts can be useful in those
situations, and also allows us to explore the many interesting steps performed
to execute almost every program in our operating systems.

Each of the manual pages and articles linked throughout the text provides more
information on any topic that may be of interest.  The implementation of these
system calls in the Linux kernel and the GNU C library is fairly approachable
once one gets accustomed to the general structure of those code bases.  GDB also
has a useful "catchpoint" command which can stop at the beginning and end of
every system call:
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ gdb a.out
Reading symbols from a.out...
(No debugging symbols found in a.out)
(gdb) catch syscall
Catchpoint 1 (any syscall)
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/a.out

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall brk), 0x00007ffff7fe8dbb in brk () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

With some experience in analyzing optimized machine language instructions, this
can be a very good way to explore the runtime behavior of a program or library.
For the bibliophiles such as myself, there are many amazing books on this topic
(there is a reason my <a href="/lib#reading-list">reading list</a> has more
operating system books than any other category).  In particular, <i>The Linux
Programming Interface</i> by Michael Kerrisk (who happens to also be the
maintainer of Linux manual pages) is a fantastic resource.

This can be verified with code such as the following:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="inline-code"><code><b>thread_local</b> <b>int</b> i;

}</code></pre>

    <b>mov</b> <b>eax</b>, DWORD <b>PTR</b> fs:0xfffffffffffffffc
    <b>ret</b></code></pre>
                    <p>
where <code>0xfffffffffffffffc</code> is a complicated spelling of
<code>-4</code> (i.e. <code>-sizeof(i)</code>) in two's complement.
Similarly, printing the address of <code>i</code> in the main thread shows that
it is located four bytes below the address passed to the
<code>arch_prctl(2)</code> call.

It is common for programs which decode system call information, such as
<code>strace</code> and <code>gdb</code>, to not have support for obscure and/or
recently-added calls or parameters.  Sometimes, they are documented in the
manual pages.  The Linux and <code>glibc</code> source code and <code>git</code>
logs are good sources of information to figure out their meaning when that is
not the case.

These values can be seen in the ELF file:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>$ objdump --all a.out | grep -A1 RELRO
   RELRO off    0x00000000000b6770 vaddr 0x00000000004b7770 paddr 0x00000000004b7770 align 2**0

                    <p>
The start address is rounded down to the page size (<code>0x4b7770 &amp; ~0xfff
= 0x4b7000</code>) and then used to calculate the new size (<code>0x3890 + 0x770
= 0x4000 = 16384</code>).
                    </p>

For readers new to <code>strace</code>, it is important to understand how these
four calls form a single overarching operation.  <code>openat(2)</code> returns
file descriptor <code>3</code> (i.e. just above
<code>stderr</code>/<code>STDERR_FILENO</code>), as indicated at the end of the
line.  Each of the subsequent calls uses that same descriptor: as the first
argument to <code>newfstatat(2)</code> (a specialized version of
<code>stat(2)</code>) and as the fifth argument to <code>mmap(2)</code>.
<code>close(2)</code>ing the descriptor finalizes the operation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
While not all operations follow this pattern (files may be kept open, calls
may be interleaved, etc.), this is a very common occurrence and worth getting
accustomed to.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li id="note4">
                    <p>
The first <code>mmap(2)</code> call, which does not specify a file descriptor
(<code>-1</code>), is actually from yet another <code>malloc(3)</code>
implementation inside the linker.
