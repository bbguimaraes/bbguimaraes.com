This post is part of a series.  You should probably start
<a href="nngn.html">here</a>.

            </aside>
            <p>
Out of sheer patriotic duty, the main component of the engine is
<a href="https://www.lua.org">Lua</a>.  The famous tiny scripting language is
the only hard dependency (other than a C++ compiler and a vaguely
POSIX-compliant operating system) and is the interstitial fluid that
coordinates all the other components.
            </p>
            <p>
The language needs no introduction: it is powerful, tiny, fast, portable, free,
built for extensibility and interoperability, has an amazing (and amazingly
simple) API&#8230; The list of compliments is almost endless, and it is
unsurprising that it is part of so many applications in vastly different
domains.
            </p>
            <p>
Lua plays a vital role in the engine.  Starting the program without further
configuration will result in an infinite loop that does nothing, not even
create a window.  The sole method of configuration is Lua scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
Command-line arguments are treated as file paths, and should initialize the
required subsystems and perform all the actions to set up whatever scenario is
desired.  The engine then assumes control and starts its main loop, although
Lua still continues to be a central part of the process, as will be described
later.
            </p>
            <p>
This has several advantages.  Minimal builds can be created very easily:
scripts can be used by any build that supports their prerequisites.  Those
attempting to use parts excluded during compilation will either get a
gracefully degraded experience or can dynamically query and adapt to the build
characteristics.  This is why every dependency other than Lua is optional.
            </p>
            <p>
Because all these scripts are written in a Turing-complete language with full
access to the engine and the operating system, there is no limit to what a
single script can do.  At the same time, utility functions from the Lua
standard library and those exported by the engine make these scripts concise:
most are a page or two of code.
            </p>
            <p>
Additionally, it allows for a very uniform interface, as will be shown in the
next sections.  They contain several code snippets directly extracted from the
repository without edits.  They are not meant to be thoroughly understood, only
provide a feel for the style of the code.

            <p>
A default configuration that includes all capabilities and loads the initial
map is a script (it is the default value for <code>argv</code>).  Its only
statements are <code>dofile</code>s (Lua's version of <code>#include</code> or
<code>import</code>) which load and execute separate, specialized scripts:
            </p>
            <pre><code>-- src/lua/all.lua

Each of these in turn is composed of lower-level pieces:

            <p>
<a href="/nngn#demos">Demos</a> and other special-purpose cases are scripts
that initialize just the parts of the engine that are necessary.  The
separation shown in the previous section allows them to choose to use the
default configuration for separate parts of the engine (keyboard bindings,
camera placement, default parameters for the various sub-systems, etc.) by
loading the appropriate script:

                    <code>socket(2)</code>
                </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
That is only part of the story.  In the spirit of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">ancient philosophy</a>
(the birthplace of scripting languages), the engine also maintains a Unix
socket in the file system while it is active.  Any data sent via this socket is
read at the top of the frame and interpreted as Lua code.
            </p>
            <p>
Being in a POSIX environment, all the power of file manipulation is made
available (i.e. the "everything is a file (descriptor)"
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file">principle</a>).
<code>netcat</code> can be used to write any text stream to the socket
(<code>nc -U</code>).   It can be invoked at a terminal with no other arguments
or redirections for a command-line console interface to the engine, or in a
pipeline to allow any program that outputs a text stream, including text
editors, to interact with the engine.
            </p>
            <p>
Wrapping <code>netcat</code> with <code>rlwrap</code> (<i>readline wrapper</i>)
gives it <code>readline</code> editing capabilities and command history.  With
a bit of glue code (which I have yet to explore), it could even provide dynamic
command-line completion.
            </p>
            <p>
This effectively extends all the flexibility of initialization described in the
previous section to runtime:
            </p>
            <h3 id="runtime-commands">
                <a href="#runtime-commands">
                    runtime commands
                </a>
            </h3>
            <p>
<code>rlwrap nc -NU path/to/sock</code> (the contents of
<code>scripts/sock.sh</code>) gives a fully-featured <code>readline</code>
shell where any ad hoc piece of Lua code can be entered and immediately
executed.
            </p>
            <p>
A limited version of this is usually implemented with some kind of virtual
console inside the engine (which also brings in a fairly heavy dependency on
font rendering).  This method gives a more powerful result mostly for free
simply by using widely available Unix facilities.
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
Any action or sequence of actions that can be performed using the Lua interface
can be placed in a script file and invoked whenever desired by sending the
contents of the file to the socket.  Examples include dumping internal
structures as text, launching auxiliary tools (more on that in a future post),
reloading assets, etc.
            </p>
            <h3 id="live-editing">
                <a href="#live-editing">

                </a>
            </h3>
            <p>
Either of the previous techniques can be used to emulate the live-editing
capability present in some programs.  Whenever a tight edit-reload loop is
required, it is very easy to create a short piece of Lua code that will reload
the asset when invoked, which can be used repeatedly or put in a script.
            </p>
            <p>
For text files, which constitute most of the assets that usually require this
sort of loop, my preferred approach is to open the file in <code>vim</code>
(the One True Text Editor) and use one of the following commands to write to
it, depending on whether a shell or Lua script for that particular case exists
or not:
            </p>
            <pre><code>:w | !nc -NU sock &lt;&lt;&lt;"…"
:w | !nc -NU sock < script.lua
:w | !script.sh</code></pre>
            <p>
From then on, <code>@:</code> in normal mode is all that is required to save
the contents of the file and see the result in the engine.

            </h2>
            <p>
The last topic I wanted to discuss where Lua plays an important role is in
serialization.  Creating
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>s is
one of the most common uses for Lua: it removes the need for custom file
formats and the associated code to load them.
            </p>
            <p>
In the repository, they fall into two categories: purely declarative and a
combination of declarative and imperative sections.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="#lson">LSON</a></h3>
            <p>
These are simply scripts that contain only static data, mostly in the form of
tables (Lua's primary data structure).  All these scripts do is
<code>return</code> the data:
            </p>
            <pre><code>-- src/lson/crono.lua
return {
    name = "crono",
    collider = {type = Collider.AABB, bb = {-8, -16, 8, -8}},
    renderer = {
        type = Renderer.SPRITE,
        tex = "img/chrono_trigger/crono.png",
        size = {32, 48}, z_off = -16,
    },
    anim = {sprite = {512//32, 512//16, {
        {{0, 6, 1,  9, 0}}, {{0, 0, 1, 3, 0}},
        {{0, 9, 1, 12, 0}}, {{0, 3, 1, 6, 0}},
        -- …
    }}},
}</code></pre>
            <p>
These files can then be loaded either by the engine or by other scripts by
simply evaluating them as Lua code.  The table will still need to be processed
by the engine to create the objects, but serialization happens automatically
without requiring a parser.  All scripts in this category are static, although
it is common to go even further and include some amount of executable code in
these files.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="#maps">maps</a></h3>
            <p>
For some cases, a purely declarative format would be unnecessarily verbose, and
ultimately insufficient.  Using the imperative aspect of a proper programming
language with access to the engine and to higher-level functions can simplify
them.
            </p>
            <p>
Map files are the primary example.  They encode all the necessary data for an
individual, self-contained area, as well as the behavior associated with it.
More specifically, these files usually have:
            <ul>
                <li>
a function that initializes the area, sometimes relying heavily on loops and
specific logic
                </li>
                <li>
a function that releases any data still in use when the area is left
                </li>
                <li>
a function that is called every frame to update area-specific objects
                </li>
                <li>
functions to handle special events (e.g. collisions)
                </li>
                <li>
local variables to share data between all of the above
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
While the manner in which the file is processed is necessarily imperative (it
is simply loaded and executed), several utility functions make the contents
mostly declarative:
            </p>
            <pre><code>-- maps/zelda.lua
-- …
local entities = {}
-- …
local function init() -- …
local function heartbeat() -- …
local function on_collision(e0, e1, v) -- …
-- …
map.map {
    name = "zelda",
    state = {ambient_light = true, zsprites = true, shadows_enabled = true},
    init = init,
    entities = entities,
    heartbeat = heartbeat,
    on_collision = on_collision,
    reset = function() nngn.lighting:set_ambient_anim{} end,
    tiles = {
        nngn.textures:load("img/zelda_sacred_grove.png"),
        2, 0, 0, 256, 256, 1, 2, {0, 0, 0, 1}}}</code></pre>

I hope this post demonstrated how fundamental Lua is for the engine.  It truly
is the brain of the system: all high-level logic lives in Lua scripts, leaving
only the lower, operating-system-level, high performance type of operations to
the engine itself.  This makes the system extremely dynamic and easy to inspect
and modify, while still maintaining native or near-native performance.
            </p>
            <p>
One last area where Lua is involved is in the interaction with external tools.
That will be the topic for the next post.
