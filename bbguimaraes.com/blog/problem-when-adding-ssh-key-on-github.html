            <p>
Recently, I had I problem with github.  I couldn't add SSH keys anymore, the
web page would just hang and present me a "Connection reset" error after a few
(annoying) minutes.  I struggled for a week, but have finally found a solution,
which is not the best, but at least I can access github from my machine once
again.
            </p>
            <p>
It all started two weeks ago, when I ran an everyday <i>git push</i>, and got a
little surprise.  It just sat there forever, and I had to <i>SIGTERM</i> it
every time.  What I did after was try to reset my key on github.  I went to the
SSH page and deleted my key, created a new one and tried to add it.
            </p>
            <p>
Yes I know it was stupid. The right way to do it would be:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    back up my key
                </li>
                <li>
                    create a new one
                </li>
                <li>
                    add it
                </li>
                <li>
                    make absolutely sure it works
                </li>
                <li>
                    remove the old one in github and on the machine
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
But I didn't, for one simple reason: adding keys has been such a natural
operation, I didn't even think about it.  Replacing a key (which I did a lot of
times when I was learning how public-key encryption works) only takes a few
seconds, and I never had to worry about it.  Until now.

I am no ssh expert.  So I turned to github's support.  And I have to say, the
response was really good, fast and to the point.  Sadly, it didn't solve the
problem.  Here is the response:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
Hi Bruno,
                </p>
                <p>
What size SSH key are you using? We have a known bug where the page will give a
500 error if the SSH key is too large.
                </p>
                <p>
I would recommend using the default size key for now, and hopefully we will
have this bug fixed soon.
                </p>
                <p>
Sorry for the trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
Cheers,
<br />
Steve
                </p>

It turns out the problem wasn't the key size, but you can see Steve gave a
really polite response.  Anyway, I started trying everything to make it work,
but in a week I just couldn't do it.  Then, yesterday, I decided to give the
developer API a try.  I didn't have much hope that it would work, because I had
tried a lot of different things and because I thought the problem was exactly
there.  But I was wrong again.
            </p>
            <p>
With just a few commands, I was able to add a ssh key to my account and finally
access my repositories.  And, in the process, I discovered a handy command line
utility, so I guess it wasn't all that bad.

                <a href="#curl-aka-curl">
                    curl (a.k.a. cURL)
                </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
curl is a program you can use to fetch web pages just as your browser would do.
It is present on most distributions, so you can start right away and run
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ curl https://bbguimaraes.com</code></pre>
            <p>
And you'll get the HTML output of the page.  You can use that to access the
github API.  To list all the keys of an account, you'd use
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ curl -u bbguimaraes https://api.github.com/user/keys</code></pre>
            <p>
Use the <i>-u</i> option to set the username.  You will be prompted for the
password.  The switch accepts the form <i>-u user:password</i>, but that just
isn't very nice.  You will get back a json output, listing all the keys
registered for your account.  There are several functions on the API, you can
take a look at them on the <a href="http://developer.github.com/">docs
page</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
But the one that did it for me was the <i>
<a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/users/keys/#create-a-public-key">create
a puclib key</a></i>.  A simple post
            </p>
            <pre><code>$ curl \
    -u bbguimaraes \
    -d <b>'{"title": "[...]", "key": "ssh-rsa AAA[...]"}'</b> \
    https://api.github.com/user/keys</code></pre>
            <p>
and, after a week of awful manual syncing of code, I was finally able to use my
beloved github repositories as I always had.  I hope this text can save you
some time if you ever happen to have the same problem.
