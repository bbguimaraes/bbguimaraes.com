            <description>The <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/genova.html">city of Ianus</a> keeps teaching me about movement and change. Ever since my first visit (of many) to Genova, I wanted to explore the coast around it, the <i lang="it">riviera ligure</i>. This weekend, after seeing that the gulf of Tigullio is only about 30km away, and that spring weather had arrived with gusto, I did what any sensible man would: got myself a bicycle and departed the very next day.</description>

For a long time, it did not appeal to me to share this aspect of my life, as it is far from being an uncommon interest, especially in the era of vain social media pretension and ostentation, and no end of people traveling to supposedly “find themselves”, but who, in the words of one of the great Roman poets, <span lang="la">“caelum, nón animum mútant, quí tráns mare currunt”</span>.</p><p>But that has gradually changed over the past few years, to the point that I have now, after a week of furious programming, added a new <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places">section</a> to this web site dedicated to it.

            <description>Legend says the city was founded by the god Janus, whose two faces watch over past and future — the ruler of time, of gates and passages, of beginnings and endings, of traveling, commerce, and sailing, of war and peace, of morning, birth, journey, transition, and change (it was in honor of him that the Romans named the first month of the year, <i lang="la">Ianuarius</i>, which marks the winter solstice and the transition between years).  This is attested by <span lang="it">Pozzo di Giano</span>, a well in what is considered the founding place of the city of Genova which, like the two-faced Janus, faces both sea and mountain.</description>

            <description>I could spend the rest of my life in Rome: every time I am there I end up spending hours in a single, small part of it, not seeing nearly enough, and leaving thinking I will have to return at least once more.  This particular time, it was this monumental complex of public baths, built at the turn of the IV century.  Located in the northeastern part of the city center, right next to the main train station, Roma Termini, it can be easily visited even during a short stay, as mine was.</description>

            <description>One of the two major early-Mediaeval peregrination routes across Western Europe — the other being, of course, the famous Camino de Santiago, which it predates by a few centuries and to which it is roughly perpendicular.  Beginning in Canterbury (specifically, Canterbury Cathedral, seat of the Archbishop of the Church of England), at the southeastern corner of Britain near the Thames estuary, it crosses France, Switzerland, and the entirety of the Italian peninsula, passing through Rome and ending in Santa Maria di Leuca in Puglia, the southeastern end of Italy, after more than three thousand kilometers.  From there pilgrims would sail across the Mediterranean to the Holy Land.  Thus it connects, together with Camino de Santiago, Compostela, Canterbury, Rome, and Jerusalem, the main peregrination sites of Christianity.</description>

            <description>As many of the cities along the Tyrrhenian coast on the ancient via Appia, Formia was a favored place for Roman seaside villae — including one belonging to the stepfather of the emperor Augustus.  Its Greek name <span lang="grc">Όρμιαι</span> (<span lang="la">Hormiae</span> in Latin, from a word for “harbor”) refers to its many ports and the mild maritime climate provided by its surroundings: the gulf of Gaeta and the monti Aurunci.  The remains of many of these villae and ports can still be seen all they from the city center to the rocky shore on the way to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8390626221">monte Scauri</a>, with salient pieces of two-thousand-year-old mosaics coming out of the rock every now and then.</description>

            <description>The Roman city of Minturnae, in the southern region of Lazio, was built in 312 B.C. on the site of the previous conquered ancient city of the same name, part of the Pentapoli Aurunca.  Its location, protected by the monti Aurunci to the north, golfo di Gaeta and mar Tirreno to the southwest, and the river Liris (now called Garigliano) to the southeast, and right on via Appia, the “regina viarum” (queen of roads, the main road connecting Rome to the southern end of the peninsula), made it a strategic point for a colony.</description>

            <description>The last stop of my marathon in the Gulf of Napoli.  I had become so enamored of the island from watching it all the way across the Gulf of Gaeta, more than 60km away — it is located right between the two gulfs, in the area where Campi Flegrei, the huge volcanic caldera, enters the Mediterranean sea, forming Penisola flegrea and the surrounding islands — seeing its dim figure through the maritime mist, its shaded contour against the colored sky at sunset, its dark green suspended in the bright blue where both sky and sea meet on sunny days (<a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/coreno-ausonio.html">see</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/castelforte.html">the</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/santi-cosma-e-damiano.html">other</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/gaeta.html">posts</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/napoli.html">where</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/capri.html">it</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/monte-solaro.html">makes</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/sorrento.html">an</a> <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/herculaneum.html">appearance</a>), that I could not leave Campania without going there.</description>

            <description>If you are obsessed with Ancient Rome as I am (as I hope you are), you knew this was coming.  After the Palatine hill in Rome itself, the most famous Roman ruins which survive to this day are certainly the city of Pompeii.  As its neighbor <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/herculaneum.html">Herculaneum</a>, it was at the time at the seaside (built on top of a layer of lava from a previous eruption), it was buried under several meters of volcanic material expelled from <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/vesuvius.html">mount Vesuvius</a> in 79 AD, remained lost for more than a millennium and a half until it was accidentally rediscovered, and now provides an unbelievable view into what life was like in the Roman empire two thousand years ago.</description>

            <description>At the foot of <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/vesuvius.html">mount Vesuvius</a> there existed, until the fated year of 79 AD, a Roman town named <i>Herculaneum</i>.  Legend says it was founded by the Greek hero <span lang="grc">Ἡρακλῆς</span> (Heracles, known to the Romans as Hercules) himself while returning from Iberia after one of his twelve labors, and named after him.  While not as large as the nearby city of <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/places/pompeii.html">Pompeii</a>, its position at (what was then) the seaside made it a retreat for Roman nobility including, it is believed, Julius Caesar's father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesonius, and its four thousand inhabitants enjoyed decent prosperity.</description>

            <description>Known to the Romans as Surrentum, from Greek Συρρεντόν, meaning “a confluence”, from the verb “συρρέω”.  A city protected by steep rock walls, with a single entrance where parts of the Greek walls and gate can still be seen, and by the waters of the gulf of Napoli.  I spent most of my time there (just over a day, unfortunately) walking Capo di Sorrento, and most of that in Bagni della Regina Giovanna, amazing Roman ruins from the 1st century AD, with its own natural swimming pool and port.</description>

These are taken over the two days I spent there, along two sentieri: one going from the famous Faraglioni up to monte Tuoro, the other crossing the entire Western coast passing through the ruins of Roman forts and rocky paths along the limestone cliffs, where dolphins and whales can be regularly seen (a pity they were too far away to get a good picture or video of them).</description>

            <description>Climbing monte Solaro in the island of Capri.  The path begins in Porto di Marina Grande, right after leaving the boat.  It goes up through tiny streets and stairs along the Northern portion of the town of Capri, then begins an almost vertical ascent through Scala Fenicia, a stairway built on the face of the mount in the 7th century B.C. by the Greek colonizers of the island (there are no pictures at this point because I was busy trying to survive the almost 1000 steps).</description>

            <description>I've been to many beautiful places in my life.  But none compares, at least in terms of pure natural beauty, to this piccola isola at the Southern end of the gulf of Napoli, a few kilometers away from the Sorrento peninsula.</description>

            <description>I was in Pompei very briefly — just a single day, on the way to and from Vesuvius.  That was much less than the four years I estimate it will take me to visit its famous ruins, given that my mind lives more in the Roman empire than in whatever this “real” life is, next time I'm there.</description>

            <description>Vesuvius rises 1281m on the coast of the gulf of Napoli.  In 79 AD it destroyed, in one of the most catastrophic eruptions in recorded history, many surrounding Roman cities.  Up to 1.5t of material were expelled per second, in clouds 33km high, releasing 100,000 times the energy of the 1945 atomic bombings.  The mountains surrounding the caldera are the remnants of the original, much higher (2km) Monte Somma, destroyed by that eruption.</description>

He passes the Italian coast by the island of the Sirens, beautiful female sea creatures who lure men to their death with their voices and music.  With counsel from the goddess and sorcerer Circe, he is able to escape the enchantment, and proceeds his travels, through the underworld of ᾍδης/Hades.</description>

Aeneas, in Virgil's Aeneid, buries his wet-nurse, Καιήτη, in this place while sailing the Lazio, giving the city its name.</description>

There is a stony road which climbs almost to the top of the hill, the highest point in the surrounding area, the village of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1235709903">Ventosa</a> and its 12th-century Romanesque watch tower, with a view of not only the valley and the vastness of the gulf, but stretching all the way to monte Cairo in the north, monti Aurunci in the west, Roccamonfina to the east, and going as far as <a href="vesuvius.html">Vesuvius</a> and the island of Ischia in the south-east when the weather is sufficiently clear.</description>

            <description>Minturnae was one of the major ancient city of the Αὔσονες/Auruncí, who inhabited the mountainous regions near the Gulf of Gaeta.  It was conquered by Rome in 314 B.C and completely destroyed, but later reconstructed as a Roman settlement and frequented by the nobility, as were the other villae maritimae on the Tyrrhenian coast: Formiae, Pirae, and Cáiéta.</description>

It is where Suio (see previous post) is contained and together with it, as the name suggests, served as a protective and vigilant center for the entire valley, from the surrounding mountains down to the delta of the river in the gulf of Gaeta.</description>

            <description><p>The power of the powerless, Václav Havel</p><p>Some literary works are considered great for their content alone, but a few can also be credited with altering the course of history.  In the case of the horrors of the 20th century, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i> is thought of as "the book which brought down the Soviet Union"; it certainly deserves the title, but it was one in a vast network of <span lang="ru">самиздат</span> (<i>samizdat</i>), covert self-published books which subverted the heavy censorship of the Soviet bloc.  Václav Havel, a poet and playwright who later became Czechoslovakia's last president, and subsequently the first of the newly-formed Czech Republic, was the author of one of these works.  His focus is not on grandiose political ideas: rather, his thesis is that it is in ordinary people, the seemingly <i>powerless</i>, where in truth all power resides.  Such ideological systems are a reflection of their own faults, of <i>living in a lie</i>, and so it is in their capacity, and their responsibility, to oppose them by <i>living within the truth</i>.</p></description>

            <description><p>Pride and prejudice, Jane Austen</p><p>While it is on the surface a romance, this alone would not account for the immense popularity of this book.  As its initial title, <i>First Impressions</i>, suggests, there is much more to it than a simple love story. It is at its core about the <i>philosophy</i> of love but, as a novelist, Austen's exploration of the theme is that of a painter or a poet: not formal but abstract, deeper and more captivating, expressing what can be felt but not easily rationalized.</p></description>

            <description>In another episode of "there was something very peculiar I wanted to do, there existed no decent guides on the internet, so here is mine": booklet printing.  I had the need to turn a LaTeX document I had produced into something physical which could be taken with me easily.  After a few days of research and experimentation and some wasted paper, I arrived at a very satisfying result.  There is something about real-life printed books (even a small one) which cannot be translated to digital media.  So here is how you can do the same for any PDF document you might have.</description>

            <description>Much has been written about the venerable <a href="https://strace.io/"><code>strace</code></a>, one of the most important allies of the systems programmer.  However, the focus is often on the specifics of the particular program being examined, not on the functioning of <code>strace</code> itself and the operating system environment involved in the execution of the process.  Today we explore this neglected part of the system call trace.</description>

            <description>One of the principal differences between C and C++ is the latter's direct support for virtual functions.  While it is entirely possible, as will be demonstrated, to implement virtual dispatch in C, C++ offers language primitives that instruct the compiler to generate the necessary back end code automatically.</description>

            <description>This is a short interlude in my series of posts.  The original post in the series <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/blog/nngn.html#ubi">briefly mentioned</a> that one of my build targets is WebAssembly, and the <a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/blog/nngn-lua.html">last one</a> was all about how Lua is a fundamental piece of the architecture.  How that build process works did not seem particularly interesting, so I did not write about it.</description>

            <description>Out of sheer patriotic duty, the main component of the engine is <a href="https://www.lua.org">Lua</a>.  The famous tiny scripting language is the only hard dependency (other than a C++ compiler and a vaguely POSIX-compliant operating system) and is the interstitial fluid that coordinates all the other components.</description>

            <description>Back in 2018, I publicized a project I had been working on intently for more than a year.  Because of the circumstances, it ended up never having its own entry here in this blog.  That is finally being corrected, and I am going to write not just one, but a series of posts about it.</description>

            <description>The two principal definitions of the dot product have always seemed incoherent to me.  After trying (and failing) to research this many times, a &lt;a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/348744"&gt;math.stackexchange.com question&lt;/a&gt; finally gave an explanation that made sense to me.  Here is my interpretation of it — and trust me, if &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can understand a mathematical concept, so can you.</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Both from personal experience and from having read all sorts of blogs, I learned that the secret to not having to give excuses for updating a blog in a very infrequent and irregular fashion is to completely ignore the fact that it has been more than a year since the last post (I would say this is an autological self-reference, but that would be paradoxically contradictory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big news this time is that from now on, the new home for this blog is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="https://bbguimaraes.com/blog"&gt;https://bbguimaraes.com/blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

I ended up buying fourteen books from O'Reilly (simply the best publisher in the technology field) on May and finally finished reading them all (exception bellow) on the first days of this year.  This a quick and informal review of each of them.</description>

            <description>If you are into unit testing, you probably have been introduced to mocking. And if that is the case, you probably already have been bitten by it. Mocking requires some understanding of code execution, importing and name resolution that most people lack when first encountering such situations. In Python, mocking is a relatively simple process, if you analyze carefully what needs to be done.</description>

            <description>Working on the command line is awesome. But there are times where all the typing gets unwieldy. No one likes to type a long file name a lot of times. Sure, using the up arrow and tab keys can make things faster sometimes, but I'll show you some tricks to make your life easier.</description>

I struggled for a week, but have finally found a solution, which is not the best, but at least I can access github from my machine once again.</description>
