                        </h3>
                        <p>
Dostoevsky's brutal masterpiece forces the reader to develop and refine his own
internal moral code as he follows Raskolnikov through the streets of
pre-Bolshevism Saint Petersburg on his increasingly febrile plans of murderous
vindication.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Reserve some time before you start reading even the first few pages, as the
ominous pace and gravitas of the unfolding plot will surely have you gripped and
rushing through the novel in a perfect reflection of the protagonist's struggle
to escape the inexorable consequences of the utopian ethics fabricated by his
mind and by his time.

                        <p>
A book which should be mandatory reading for every man entering adult life.
With deep roots in classical Greek and early Christian philosophy, these notes
by Marcus Aurelius (the last of the "Good Emperors", maintainers of the Pax
Romana in the first two centuries A.D.), written in the last third of his life,
describe his conception of masculine virtue.

Never intended to be published (the original is unnamed, but the Greek title
means literally "those to one's self"), the text has a strongly personal tone,
and an abundance of incisive aphorisms:

One of the Platonic dialogues which depicts the last days of Socrates (together
with <i>Euthyphro</i>, <i>Crito</i>, <i>Phaedo</i>, and Xenophon's
<i>Apology</i>).  Having been accused of "corrupting the youth" and teaching men
"not to receive the gods whom the city receives", and knowing what his fate is,
the philosopher consults his δαιμόνιον (<i lang="grc">daimonion</i>, his "divine
faculty") and decides that, rather than desisting and escaping from his trial,
as his prosecutors would have him do, he is to deliver his defense in front of
the court and face the ultimate consequence.

While it is on the surface a romance, this alone would not account for the
immense popularity of this book.  As its initial title, <i>First
Impressions</i>, suggests, there is much more to it than a simple love story.
It is at its core about the <i>philosophy</i> of love but, as a novelist,
Austen's exploration of the theme is that of a painter or a poet: not formal but
abstract, deeper and more captivating, expressing what can be felt but not
easily rationalized.

An introduction to the extremely effective combination of Test Driven
Development and systematic code editing procedures.  This book thoroughly
describes how to structure code for robustness and how to change and evolve it
while maintaining its integrity and guaranteeing no regressions are introduced.

I had the luck of finding a copy in my university's library and reading it in
my first few semesters there: it shaped how I write and edit code from the
beginning.

A detailed, low-level analysis of the implementation of operating systems with
examples from the early versions of Unix.  Each subsystem is described, from the
hardware to the user programs: algorithms and data structures are presented,
with a generous amount of diagrams and C code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
A reference for programmers writing system code and a guide for those
interacting with it, this book is indispensable for anyone working with Unix,
the most influential operating system in history, or any of its descendants.

Undoubtedly the best introductory programming book for Compute Science courses.
Lisp and the rich collection of problems and exercises presented throughout the
book will fundamentally transform how a programmer views and reasons about code
and computation in general, even for those who program in different languages
and paradigms.

A very good introduction to Test Driven Development with an emphasis on systems
programming for embedded devices.  Always in a very practical manner, sample
programs of progressive complexity &mdash; from simple unit tests to black-box
integration tests involving several components &mdash; are presented along with
techniques to address the challenges inherent in designing software for
constrained hardware platforms.

The latest revision of the mandatory reading series for C++ programmers.  Each
new revision of the language (a steady process every three years now, since
C++11) has introduced powerful and expressive constructs, always building on top
of previous ones.  The <i>Effective</i> series presents these new concepts in a
pragmatic way with copious code examples and is considered a reference for best
practices and guidelines among C++ programmers.

A programming guide for this extremely elegant language.  Lua is unique in many
aspects of its design, not least of which is its simplicity.  Very few &mdash;
but powerful &mdash; language constructs underlie the implementation of concepts
found in most programming languages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
This book presents common programming topics from the idiosyncratic point of
view of Lua and will teach all that is necessary for someone interested in using
it either directly or as an auxiliary scripting language in a larger program.
