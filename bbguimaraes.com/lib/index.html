                </h3>
                <p>
Dostoevsky's brutal masterpiece forces the reader to develop and refine his own
internal moral code as he follows Raskolnikov through the streets of
pre-Bolshevism Saint Petersburg on his increasingly febrile plans of murderous
vindication.
                </p>

Reserve some time before you start reading even the first few pages, as the
ominous pace and gravitas of the unfolding plot will surely have you gripped and
rushing through the novel in a perfect reflection of the protagonist's struggle
to escape the inexorable consequences of the utopian ethics fabricated by his
mind and by his time.

                </h3>
                <p>
A book which should be mandatory reading for every man entering adult life.
With deep roots in classical Greek and early Christian philosophy, these notes
by Marcus Aurelius (the last of the &quot;Good Emperors&quot;, maintainers of
the Pax Romana in the first two centuries A.D.), written in the last third of
his life, describe his conception of masculine virtue.
                </p>
                <p>
Never intended to be published (the original is unnamed, but the Greek title
means literally &quot;those to one's self&quot;), the text has a strongly
personal tone, and an abundance of incisive aphorisms:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
Nothing is either bad or good which can happen equally to the bad man and the
good.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
I seek the truth by which no man has ever injured, but he is injured who abides
in his error and ignorance.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
Cast away opinion: thou art saved.  Who then hinders thee from casting it away?
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
A perfect encapsulation of Stoic thought, with the constant emphasis that
resilience is to be found in living according to the precepts of nature and in
adhering to and maintaining the purity of the &quot;divinity planted in every
man&quot; (<i>eudaimonia</i>).

                <p>
The World State in the Year of Our Ford 632 is perfectly constructed: humans are
produced in laboratories, engineered and conditioned for their societal purpose,
kept young until their death, with free access to drugs and all sorts of
technological amenities.
                </p>
                <p>
Women are infertile or expertly trained in contraceptive rituals, encouraged to
have as many partners as possible, and, if they ever &quot;feel out of
sorts&quot;, administered a <i>passion surrogate</i> or <i>pregnancy
substitute</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
Life is for pleasure and pleasure is always available.  <i>Everyone belongs to
everyone else</i>, <i>history is bunk</i>, <i>progress is lovely</i>, and so on
go the commanding edicts, instilled from infancy.  Yet, despite the comfort of
their perfect, sanitized life, despite the abundant <i>happiness</i>, citizens
yearn for something else, though they cannot name it.  <i>To be free to be
happy</i>, <i>in your own way</i>.  <i>To feel something strongly</i>.  To <i>do
something much more important</i>, <i>more intense</i>, <i>more violent</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
Huxley's novel is remarkable in its prophecy &mdash; now more than ever since
its publishing in 1932.  But it is primarily an ode to the human spirit and its
rebellion against the forces that seek to dominate and control it.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>But I don't want comfort.</p>
                    <p>
I want God,<br />
I want poetry,<br />
I want real danger,<br />
I want freedom,<br />
I want goodness.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>I want sin.</p>
                    <p>
[…] I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.  […] I claim them all.
                    </p>

A detailed, low-level analysis of the implementation of operating systems with

with a generous amount of diagrams and C code.

                <p>
A detailed introduction to programming for heterogeneous devices, this book
presents the OpenCL language along with its C API.  Additionally, each component
is contextualized with discussions of traditional architectures for CPUs,
GPUs, FPGAs, and other devices and several case studies, with accompanying
source code examples.
