                    Fyodor Dostoevsky
                </h3>
                <p>
Dostoevsky's brutal masterpiece forces the reader to develop and refine his own
internal moral code as he follows Raskolnikov through the streets of
pre-Bolshevism Saint Petersburg on his increasingly febrile plans of murderous
vindication.
                </p>
                <p>
Reserve some time before you start reading even the first few pages, as the
ominous pace and gravitas of the unfolding plot will surely have you gripped and
rushing through the novel in a perfect reflection of the protagonist's struggle
to escape the inexorable consequences of the utopian ethics fabricated by his
mind and by his time.

                </h3>
                <p>
A book which should be mandatory reading for every man entering adult life.
With deep roots in classical Greek and early Christian philosophy, these notes
by Marcus Aurelius (the last of the "Good Emperors", maintainers of the Pax
Romana in the first two centuries A.D.), written in the last third of his life,
describe his conception of masculine virtue.
                </p>
                <p>
Never intended to be published (the original is unnamed, but the Greek title
means literally "those to one's self"), the text has a strongly personal tone,
and an abundance of incisive aphorisms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>
Nothing is either bad or good which can happen equally to the bad man and the
good.
                    </i></li>
                    <li><i>
I seek the truth by which no man has ever injured, but he is injured who abides
in his error and ignorance.
                    </i></li>
                    <li><i>
Cast away opinion: thou art saved.  Who then hinders thee from casting it away?
                    </i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
A perfect encapsulation of Stoic thought, with the constant emphasis that
resilience is to be found in living according to the precepts of nature and in
adhering to and maintaining the purity of the "divinity planted in every man"
(<i>eudaimonia</i>).

Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the
perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction,
and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing devoid of
judgement.  And, to say all in a word, everything which belongs to the body is a
stream, and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapour, and life is a
warfare and a stranger’s sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion.  What then is that
which is able to conduct a man?  One thing and only one, philosophy.  But this
consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed,
superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely
and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man’s doing or not doing
anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as
coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally,
waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution
of the elements of which every living being is compounded.  But if there is no
harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, why
should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the
elements?  For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according
to nature.

If thou findest in human life anything better than justice, truth, temperance,
fortitude, and, in a word, anything better than thy own mind’s self-satisfaction
in the things which it enables thee to do according to right reason, and in the
condition that is assigned to thee without thy own choice; if, I say, thou seest
anything better than this, turn to it with all thy soul, and enjoy that which
thou hast found to be the best.  But if nothing appears to be better than the
deity which is planted in thee, which has subjected to itself all thy appetites,
and carefully examines all the impressions, and, as Socrates said, has detached
itself from the persuasions of sense, and has submitted itself to the gods, and
cares for mankind; if thou findest everything else smaller and of less value
than this, give place to nothing else, for if thou dost once diverge and incline
to it, thou wilt no longer without distraction be able to give the preference to
that good thing which is thy proper possession and thy own; for it is not right
that anything of any other kind, such as praise from the many, or power, or
enjoyment of pleasure, should come into competition with that which is
rationally and politically or practically good.  All these things, even though
they may seem to adapt themselves to the better things in a small degree, obtain
the superiority all at once, and carry us away.  But do thou, I say, simply and
freely choose the better, and hold to it.  &mdash; But that which is useful is
the better.  &mdash; Well then, if it is useful to thee as a rational being,
keep to it; but if it is only useful to thee as an animal, say so, and maintain
thy judgement without arrogance: only take care that thou makest the inquiry by
a sure method.

Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, seashores, and
mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much.  But this is
altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power
whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself.  For nowhere either with more
quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul,
particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he
is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing
else than the good ordering of the mind.  Constantly then give to thyself this
retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental,
which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the
soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things
to which thou returnest.  For with what art thou discontented?  With the badness
of men?  Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals exist for one
another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong
involuntarily; and consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion,
hatred, and fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet
at last.  &mdash; But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned
to thee out of the universe.  &mdash; Recall to thy recollection this
alternative; either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of
things; or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is
a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.  &mdash; But perhaps
corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.  &mdash; Consider then further
that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or violently,
when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also
of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be
quiet at last.  &mdash; But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will
torment thee.  &mdash; See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the
chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of
applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to
give praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed,
and be quiet at last.  For the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in
it is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people

This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory of thy own, and
above all do not distract or strain thyself, but be free, and look at things as
a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal.  But among the things
readiest to thy hand to which thou shalt turn, let there be these, which are
two.  One is that things do not touch the soul, for they are external and remain
immovable; but our perturbations come only from the opinion which is within.
The other is that all these things, which thou seest, change immediately and
will no longer be; and constantly bear in mind how many of these changes thou
hast already witnessed. The universe is transformation: life is opinion.

If our intellectual part is common, the reason also, in respect of which we are
rational beings, is common: if this is so, common also is the reason which
commands us what to do, and what not to do; if this is so, there is a common law
also; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens; if this is so, we are members of
some political community; if this is so, the world is in a manner a state.  For
of what other common political community will anyone say that the whole human
race are members?  And from thence, from this common political community comes
also our very intellectual faculty and reasoning faculty and our capacity for
law; or whence do they come?  For as my earthly part is a portion given to me
from certain earth, and that which is watery from another element, and that
which is hot and fiery from some peculiar source (for nothing comes out of that
which is nothing, as nothing also returns to nonexistence), so also the
intellectual part comes from some source.

He who acts unjustly acts impiously.  For since the universal nature has made
rational animals for the sake of one another to help one another according to
their deserts, but in no way to injure one another, he who transgresses her
will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity.  And he too who
lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity; for the universal nature is the
nature of things that are; and things that are have a relation to all things
that come into existence.  And further, this universal nature is named truth,
and is the prime cause of all things that are true.  He then who lies
intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by deceiving;
and he also who lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is at variance with the
universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs the order by fighting against the
nature of the world; for he fights against it, who is moved of himself to that
which is contrary to truth, for he had received powers from nature through the
neglect of which he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth.  And
indeed he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of
impiety.  For of necessity such a man must often find fault with the universal
nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and the good contrary to
their deserts, because frequently the bad are in the enjoyment of pleasure and
possess the things which procure pleasure, but the good have pain for their
share and the things which cause pain.  And further, he who is afraid of pain
will sometimes also be afraid of some of the things which will happen in the
world, and even this is impiety.  And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain
from injustice, and this is plainly impiety.  Now with respect to the things
towards which the universal nature is equally affected &mdash; for it would not
have made both, unless it was equally affected towards both &mdash; towards
these they who wish to follow nature should be of the same mind with it, and
equally affected.  With respect to pain, then, and pleasure, or death and life,
or honour and dishonour, which the universal nature employs equally, whoever is
not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously.  And I say that the
universal nature employs them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike
to those who are produced in continuous series and to those who come after them
by virtue of a certain original movement of Providence, according to which it
moved from a certain beginning to this ordering of things, having conceived
certain principles of the things which were to be, and having determined powers
productive of beings and of changes and of suchlike successions.

The World State in the Year of Our Ford 632 is perfectly constructed: humans are
produced in laboratories, engineered and conditioned for their societal purpose,
kept young until their death, with free access to drugs and all sorts of
technological amenities.
                </p>
                <p>
Women are infertile or expertly trained in contraceptive rituals, encouraged to
have as many partners as possible, and, if they ever "feel out of sorts",
administered a <i>passion surrogate</i> or <i>pregnancy substitute</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
Life is for pleasure and pleasure is always available.  <i>Everyone belongs to
everyone else</i>, <i>history is bunk</i>, <i>progress is lovely</i>, and so on
go the commanding edicts, instilled from infancy.  Yet, despite the comfort of
their perfect, sanitized life, despite the abundant <i>happiness</i>, citizens
yearn for something else, though they cannot name it.  <i>To be free to be
happy</i>, <i>in your own way</i>.  <i>To feel something strongly</i>.  To <i>do
something much more important</i>, <i>more intense</i>, <i>more violent</i>.

Huxley's novel is remarkable in its prophecy &mdash; now more than ever since
its publishing in 1932.  But it is primarily an ode to the human spirit and its
rebellion against the forces that seek to dominate and control it.

                <p>
An introduction to the extremely effective combination of Test Driven
Development and systematic code editing procedures.  This book thoroughly
describes how to structure code for robustness and how to change and evolve it
while maintaining its integrity and guaranteeing no regressions are introduced.

I had the luck of finding a copy in my university's library and reading it in
my first few semesters there: it shaped how I write and edit code from the
beginning.

                <p>
A detailed, low-level analysis of the implementation of operating systems with
examples from the early versions of Unix.  Each subsystem is described, from the
hardware to the user programs: algorithms and data structures are presented,
with a generous amount of diagrams and C code.
                </p>
                <p>
A reference for programmers writing system code and a guide for those
interacting with it, this book is indispensable for anyone working with Unix,
the most influential operating system in history, or any of its descendants.

Undoubtedly the best introductory programming book for Compute Science courses.
Lisp and the rich collection of problems and exercises presented throughout the
book will fundamentally transform how a programmer views and reasons about code
and computation in general, even for those who program in different languages
and paradigms.

A very good introduction to Test Driven Development with an emphasis on systems
programming for embedded devices.  Always in a very practical manner, sample
programs of progressive complexity &mdash; from simple unit tests to black-box
integration tests involving several components &mdash; are presented along with
techniques to address the challenges inherent in designing software for
constrained hardware platforms.

The latest revision of the mandatory reading series for C++ programmers.  Each
new revision of the language (a steady process every three years now, since
C++11) has introduced powerful and expressive constructs, always building on top
of previous ones.  The <i>Effective</i> series presents these new concepts in a
pragmatic way with copious code examples and is considered a reference for best
practices and guidelines among C++ programmers.

                <p>
A programming guide for this extremely elegant language.  Lua is unique in many
aspects of its design, not least of which is its simplicity.  Very few &mdash;
but powerful &mdash; language constructs underlie the implementation of concepts
found in most programming languages.
                </p>
                <p>
This book presents common programming topics from the idiosyncratic point of
view of Lua and will teach all that is necessary for someone interested in using
it either directly or as an auxiliary scripting language in a larger program.
