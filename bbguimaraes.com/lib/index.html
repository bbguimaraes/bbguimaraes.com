                        </h3>
                        <p>
Some literary works are considered great for their content alone, but a few can
also be credited with altering the course of history.  In the case of the
horrors of the 20th century, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's <i>The Gulag
Archipelago</i> is thought of as "the book which brought down the Soviet Union";
it certainly deserves the title, but it was one in a vast network of <span
lang="ru">самиздат</span> (<i>samizdat</i>), covert self-published books which
subverted the heavy censorship of the Soviet bloc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Václav Havel, a poet and playwright who later became Czechoslovakia's last
president, and subsequently the first of the newly-formed Czech Republic, was
the author of one of these works.  His focus is not on grandiose political
ideas: rather, his thesis is that it is in ordinary people, the seemingly
<i>powerless</i>, where in truth all power resides.  Such ideological systems
are a reflection of their own faults, of <i>living in a lie</i>, and so it is in
their capacity, and their responsibility, to oppose them by <i>living within the
truth</i>.

                        <p>
While it is on the surface a romance, this alone would not account for the
immense popularity of this book.  As its initial title, <i>First
Impressions</i>, suggests, there is much more to it than a simple love story.
It is at its core about the <i>philosophy</i> of love but, as a novelist,
Austen's exploration of the theme is that of a painter or a poet: not formal but
abstract, deeper and more captivating, expressing what can be felt but not
easily rationalized.

One of the Platonic dialogues which depicts the last days of Socrates (together
with <i>Euthyphro</i>, <i>Crito</i>, <i>Phaedo</i>, and Xenophon's
<i>Apology</i>).  Having been accused of "corrupting the youth" and teaching men
"not to receive the gods whom the city receives", and knowing what his fate is,
the philosopher consults his δαιμόνιον (<i lang="grc">daimonion</i>, his "divine
faculty") and decides that, rather than desisting and escaping from his trial,
as his prosecutors would have him do, he is to deliver his defense in front of
the court and face the ultimate consequence.

                        <p>
A book which should be mandatory reading for every man entering adult life.
With deep roots in classical Greek and early Christian philosophy, these notes
by Marcus Aurelius (the last of the "Good Emperors", maintainers of the Pax
Romana in the first two centuries A.D.), written in the last third of his life,
describe his conception of masculine virtue.

Never intended to be published (the original is unnamed, but the Greek title
means literally "those to one's self"), the text has a strongly personal tone,
and an abundance of incisive aphorisms:

                        <p>
Dostoevsky's brutal masterpiece forces the reader to develop and refine his own
internal moral code as he follows Raskolnikov through the streets of
pre-Bolshevism Saint Petersburg on his increasingly febrile plans of murderous
vindication.

                        <p>
Reserve some time before you start reading even the first few pages, as the
ominous pace and gravitas of the unfolding plot will surely have you gripped and
rushing through the novel in a perfect reflection of the protagonist's struggle
to escape the inexorable consequences of the utopian ethics fabricated by his
mind and by his time.

A programming guide for this extremely elegant language.  Lua is unique in many
aspects of its design, not least of which is its simplicity.  Very few &mdash;
but powerful &mdash; language constructs underlie the implementation of concepts
found in most programming languages.

view of Lua and will teach all that is necessary for someone interested in using
it either directly or as an auxiliary scripting language in a larger program.

The latest revision of the mandatory reading series for C++ programmers.  Each
new revision of the language (a steady process every three years now, since

of previous ones.  The <i>Effective</i> series presents these new concepts in a
pragmatic way with copious code examples and is considered a reference for best
practices and guidelines among C++ programmers.

integration tests involving several components &mdash; are presented along with
techniques to address the challenges inherent in designing software for
constrained hardware platforms.

book will fundamentally transform how a programmer views and reasons about code
and computation in general, even for those who program in different languages
and paradigms.
