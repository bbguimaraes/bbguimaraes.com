                Fyodor Dostoevsky

Dostoevsky's brutal masterpiece forces the reader to develop and refine his own
internal moral code as he follows Raskolnikov through the streets of
pre-Bolshevism Saint Petersburg on his increasingly febrile plans of murderous
vindication.

Reserve some time before you start reading even the first few pages, as the
ominous pace and gravitas of the unfolding plot will surely have you gripped and
rushing through the novel in a perfect reflection of the protagonist's struggle
to escape the inexorable consequences of the utopian ethics fabricated by his
mind and by his time.
