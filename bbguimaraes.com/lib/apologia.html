            <p>
One of the Platonic dialogues which depicts the last days of Socrates (together
with <i>Euthyphro</i>, <i>Crito</i>, <i>Phaedo</i>, and Xenophon's
<i>Apology</i>).  Having been accused of "corrupting the youth" and teaching men
"not to receive the gods whom the city receives", and knowing what his fate is,
the philosopher consults his δαιμόνιον (<i lang="grc">daimonion</i>, his "divine
faculty") and decides that, rather than desisting and escaping from his trial,
as his prosecutors would have him do, he is to deliver his defense in front of
the court and face the ultimate consequence.
            </p>
            <p>
This can be considered the quintessential Socratic dialogue: it contains many of
the idiosyncratic elements he is most renowned for.  His traditional manner of
speaking (the eponymous <i>Socratic irony</i>) is present from the opening and
made almost mythical in the famous account of the pronunciation by the oracle of
Delphi that he was the wisest man.  This he discovers to be not for what he
knows ("for I know that I have no wisdom, small or great"), but because the
awareness of his ignorance ensures his humility, and his subsequent search and
examination of truly wise men so that she could be refuted leads to the
discovery that none was indeed wise, but only thought himself to be.
            </p>
            <p>
A few centuries later, Cicero would write that in his trial Socrates spoke
<i lang="la">ut non supplex aut reus, sed magister, aut dominus videretur esse
iudicum</i> ("as to be seen not supplicant as a defendant, but great as a master
of the judges").  He is the embodiment of the <em>free</em> man, in the
classical (and true) sense: liberated from mundane vices, his life is dedicated,
to the end, to what is truly important, <em>virtue</em>.  In the strength of his
conviction, integrity, and rectitude, not even death is a threat: fear of it is
"pretense of wisdom".  Nothing will injure him: his accusers and adjudicators
have no power, "for a bad man is not permitted to injure a better than himself",
and "no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death".
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of death &mdash;
they too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy
and wrong.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
The source of his fortitude is obstinate devotion, as his duty is eminently
<em>religious</em>: "I shall obey God rather than you".  Similar is his
inference from the Pythian augury: "but the truth is, O men of Athens, that God
only is wise".  And his moral concern is not only for himself, but for the soul
of his fellow citizens, and even of his accusers: he argues not for his sake,
"but for yours, that you may not sin against the God by condemning me".  And as
"God orders me to fulfill the philosopher's mission of searching into myself and
other men", betraying this commandment would be not only immoral, but impious:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to die many times.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
I would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and
live.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
A man who is good for anything ought only to consider whether in doing anything
he is doing right or wrong[&hellip;]; he should not think of death or anything
but of disgrace.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
For if, O men of Athens, by force of persuasion and entreaty I could overpower
your oaths, then I should be teaching you to believe that there are no gods, and
in defending should simply convict myself of the charge of not believing in
them.  But that is not so &mdash; far otherwise.  For I do believe that there
are gods, and in a sense higher than that in which any of my accusers believe in
them.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
Socrates was tried and executed in 4th-century B.C. Athens, but in a time when
the trial of public opinion still coerces and silences, when death is to be
avoided at all costs, when freedom is thought to be licentiousness,
incontinence, exemption from consequence, and subordination to nothing and to no
one, in a time of meaninglessness, moral relativism, and confusion, his apology
shows that there are things worth living &mdash; and dying &mdash; for:
<i>wisdom, truth, and the greatest improvement of the soul</i>.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways &mdash; I to die, and you
to live. Which is better God only knows.
                </p>

I dare say, Athenians, that someone among you will reply, "Yes, Socrates, but
what is the origin of these accusations which are brought against you; there
must have been something strange which you have been doing?  All these rumours
and this talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men:
tell us, then, what is the cause of them, for we should be sorry to judge
hastily of you".  Now I regard this as a fair challenge, and I will endeavour to
explain to you the reason why I am called wise and have such an evil fame.
Please to attend then.  And although some of you may think that I am joking, I
declare that I will tell you the entire truth.  Men of Athens, this reputation
of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess.  If you ask me
what kind of wisdom, I reply, wisdom such as may perhaps be attained by man, for
to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons of
whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which I may fail to describe,
because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have, speaks falsely, and
is taking away my character.  And here, O men of Athens, I must beg you not to
interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant.  For the word which I
will speak is not mine.  I will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit;
that witness shall be the God of Delphi &mdash; he will tell you about my
wisdom, if I have any, and of what sort it is.  You must have known Chaerephon;
he was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he shared in the
recent exile of the people, and returned with you.  Well, Chaerephon, as you
know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly
asked the oracle to tell him whether &mdash; as I was saying, I must beg you not
to interrupt &mdash; he asked the oracle to tell him whether anyone was wiser
than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered, that there was no man wiser.
Chaerephon is dead himself; but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the
truth of what I am saying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Why do I mention this?  Because I am going to explain to you why I have such an
evil name.  When I heard the answer, I said to myself "What can the god mean,
and what is the interpretation of his riddle?" for I know that I have no wisdom,
small or great.  What then can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men?
And yet he is a god, and cannot lie; that would be against his nature.  After
long consideration, I thought of a method of trying the question.  I reflected
that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god
with a refutation in my hand.  I should say to him, "Here is a man who is wiser
than I am; but you said that I was the wisest".

Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed him
&mdash; his name I need not mention; he was a politician whom I selected for
examination &mdash; and the result was as follows: when I began to talk with
him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was
thought wise by many, and still wiser by himself; and thereupon I tried to
explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the
consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were
present and heard me.  So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: "Well,
although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and
good, I am better off than he is &mdash; for he knows nothing, and thinks that
he knows; I neither know nor think that I know".  In this latter particular,
then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him.  Then I went to another who
had still higher pretensions to wisdom, and my conclusion was exactly the same.
Whereupon I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Then I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which
I provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon me
&mdash; the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first.  And I said to
myself "go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the
oracle".  And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear!  &mdash; for I must
tell you the truth &mdash; the result of my mission was just this: I found that
the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that others less
esteemed were really wiser and better.  I will tell you the tale of my
wanderings and of the "Herculean" labours, as I may call them, which I endured
only to find at last the oracle irrefutable.

After the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts.
And there, I said to myself: "you will be instantly detected; now you will find
out that you are more ignorant than they are".  Accordingly, I took them some of
the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the
meaning of them &mdash; thinking that they would teach me something.  Will you
believe me?  I am almost ashamed to confess the truth, but I must say that there
is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry
than they did themselves.  Then I knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry,
but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers
who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them.  The
poets appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that
upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of
men in other things in which they were not wise.  So I departed, conceiving
myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the
politicians.

At last I went to the artisans.  I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as
I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and here I was not
mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this
they certainly were wiser than I was.  But I observed that even the good
artisans fell into the same error as the poets; &mdash; because they were good
workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this
defect in them overshadowed their wisdom; and therefore I asked myself on behalf
of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their
knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to myself
and to the oracle that I was better off as I was.

This inquisition has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most
dangerous kind, and has given occasion also to many calumnies.  And I am called
wise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom which I
find wanting in others: but the truth is, O men of Athens, that God only is
wise; and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth
little or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name by
way of illustration, as if he said: "He, O men, is the wisest, who, like
Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing".  And so I go about
the world, obedient to the god, and search and make enquiry into the wisdom of
anyone, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if he is not
wise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is not wise; and my
occupation quite absorbs me, and I have no time to give either to any public
matter of interest or to any concern of my own, but I am in utter poverty by
reason of my devotion to the god.

&ndash; And now, Meletus, I will ask you another question &mdash; by Zeus I
will: Which is better, to live among bad citizens, or among good ones?  Answer,
friend, I say; the question is one which may be easily answered.  Do not the
good do their neighbours good, and the bad do them evil?

who live with him?  Answer, my good friend, the law requires you to answer
&mdash; does anyone like to be injured?

the evil do them evil.  Now, is that a truth which your superior wisdom has
recognized thus early in life, and am I, at my age, in such darkness and
ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom I have to live is corrupted by
me, I am very likely to be harmed by him; and yet I corrupt him, and
intentionally, too &mdash; so you say, although neither I nor any other human
being is ever likely to be convinced by you.  But either I do not corrupt them,
or I corrupt them unintentionally; and on either view of the case you lie.  If
my offence is unintentional, the law has no cognizance of unintentional
offences: you ought to have taken me privately, and warned and admonished me;
for if I had been better advised, I should have left off doing what I only did
unintentionally &mdash; no doubt I should; but you would have nothing to say to
me and refused to teach me.  And now you bring me up in this court, which is a
place not of instruction, but of punishment.  It will be very clear to you,
Athenians, as I was saying, that Meletus has no care at all, great or small,

human beings?  &hellip; I wish, men of Athens, that he would answer, and not be
always trying to get up an interruption.  Did ever any man believe in
horsemanship, and not in horses?  Or in flute-playing, and not in flute-players?
No, my friend; I will answer to you and to the court, as you refuse to answer
for yourself.  There is no man who ever did.  But now please to answer the next
question: Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits
or demigods?
                    </p>
                    <p>
&ndash; He cannot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
&ndash; How lucky I am to have extracted that answer, by the assistance of the
court!  But then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in divine
or spiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); at any rate, I believe
in spiritual agencies &mdash; so you say and swear in the affidavit; and yet if
I believe in divine beings, how can I help believing in spirits or demigods;
&mdash; must I not?  To be sure I must; and therefore I may assume that your
silence gives consent.  Now what are spirits or demigods?  Are they not either
gods or the sons of gods?
                    </p>
                    <p>
&ndash; Certainly they are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
&ndash; But this is what I call the facetious riddle invented by you: the
demigods or spirits are gods, and you say first that I do not believe in gods,
and then again that I do believe in gods; that is, if I believe in demigods.
For if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods, whether by the nymphs or
by any other mothers, of whom they are said to be the sons &mdash; what human
being will ever believe that there are no gods if they are the sons of gods?
You might as well affirm the existence of mules, and deny that of horses and
asses.  Such nonsense, Meletus, could only have been intended by you to make
trial of me.  You have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real
of which to accuse me.  But no one who has a particle of understanding will ever
be convinced by you that the same men can believe in divine and superhuman
things, and yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes.

Someone will say: "And are you not ashamed, Socrates, of a course of life which
is likely to bring you to an untimely end?".  To him I may fairly answer: there
you are mistaken: a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the
chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything
he is doing right or wrong &mdash; acting the part of a good man or of a bad.
Whereas, upon your view, the heroes who fell at Troy were not good for much, and
the son of Thetis above all, who altogether despised danger in comparison with
disgrace; and when he was so eager to slay Hector, his goddess mother said to
him, that if he avenged his companion Patroclus, and slew Hector, he would die
himself &mdash; "Fate", she said, in these or the like words, "waits for you
next after Hector"; he, receiving this warning, utterly despised danger and
death, and instead of fearing them, feared rather to live in dishonour, and not
to avenge his friend.  "Let me die forthwith", he replies, "and be avenged of my
enemy, rather than abide here by the beaked ships, a laughingstock and a burden
of the earth".  Had Achilles any thought of death and danger?
                    </p>
                    <p>
And this, O men of Athens, is a true saying.  For wherever a man's place is,
whether the place which he has chosen or that in which he has been placed by a
commander, there he ought to remain in the hour of danger; he should not think
of death or of anything but of disgrace.  Strange, indeed, would be my conduct,
O men of Athens, if I who, when I was ordered by the generals whom you chose to
command me at Potidaea and Amphipolis and Delium, remained where they placed me,
like any other man, facing death &mdash; if now, when, as I conceive and
imagine, God orders me to fulfil the philosopher's mission of searching into
myself and other men, I were to desert my post through fear of death, or any
other fear; that would indeed be strange, and I might justly be arraigned in
court for denying the existence of the gods, if I disobeyed the oracle because I
was afraid of death, fancying that I was wise when I was not wise.  For the fear
of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being a pretence
of knowing the unknown; and no one knows whether death, which men in their fear
apprehend to be the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.  Is not this
ignorance of a disgraceful sort, the ignorance which is the conceit that a man
knows what he does not know?  And in this respect only I believe myself to
differ from men in general, and may perhaps claim to be wiser than they are:
&mdash; that whereas I know but little of the world below, I do not suppose that
I know: but I do know that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God
or man, is evil and dishonourable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible
good rather than a certain evil.  And therefore if you let me go now, and are
not convinced by Anytus, who said that since I had been prosecuted I must be put
to death; (or if not that I ought never to have been prosecuted at all); and
that if I escape now, your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my
words &mdash; if you say to me, "Socrates, this time we will not mind Anytus,
and you shall be let off, but upon one condition, that you are not to enquire
and speculate in this way any more, and that if you are caught doing so again
you shall die"; &mdash; if this was the condition on which you let me go, I
should reply: men of Athens, I honour and love you; but I shall obey God rather
than you, and while I have life and strength I shall never cease from the
practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting anyone whom I meet and saying to
him after my manner: You, my friend &mdash; a citizen of the great and mighty
and wise city of Athens &mdash; are you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest
amount of money and honour and reputation, and caring so little about wisdom and
truth and the greatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed
at all?  And if the person with whom I am arguing, says: "Yes, but I do care";
then I do not leave him or let him go at once; but I proceed to interrogate and
examine and cross-examine him, and if I think that he has no virtue in him, but
only says that he has, I reproach him with undervaluing the greater, and
overvaluing the less.  And I shall repeat the same words to everyone whom I
meet, young and old, citizen and alien, but especially to the citizens, inasmuch
as they are my brethren.  For know that this is the command of God; and I
believe that no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service to
the God.  For I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike,
not to take thought for your persons or your properties, but first and chiefly
to care about the greatest improvement of the soul.  I tell you that virtue is
not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of
man, public as well as private.  This is my teaching, and if this is the
doctrine which corrupts the youth, I am a mischievous person.  But if anyone
says that this is not my teaching, he is speaking an untruth.  Wherefore, O men
of Athens, I say to you, do as Anytus bids or not as Anytus bids, and either
acquit me or not; but whichever you do, understand that I shall never alter my
ways, not even if I have to die many times.

you.  You will not easily find another like me, and therefore I would advise you
to spare me.  I dare say that you may feel out of temper (like a person who is
suddenly awakened from sleep), and you think that you might easily strike me
dead as Anytus advises, and then you would sleep on for the remainder of your
lives, unless God in his care of you sent you another gadfly.  When I say that I
am given to you by God, the proof of my mission is this: &mdash; if I had been
like other men, I should not have neglected all my own concerns or patiently
seen the neglect of them during all these years, and have been doing yours,
coming to you individually like a father or elder brother, exhorting you to
regard virtue; such conduct, I say, would be unlike human nature.  If I had
gained anything, or if my exhortations had been paid, there would have been some
sense in my doing so; but now, as you will perceive, not even the impudence of
my accusers dares to say that I have ever exacted or sought pay of anyone; of
that they have no witness.  And I have a sufficient witness to the truth of what
I say &mdash; my poverty.

But, having regard to public opinion, I feel that such conduct would be
discreditable to myself, and to you, and to the whole state.  One who has
reached my years, and who has a name for wisdom, ought not to demean himself.
Whether this opinion of me be deserved or not, at any rate the world has decided
that Socrates is in some way superior to other men.  And if those among you who
are said to be superior in wisdom and courage, and any other virtue, demean
themselves in this way, how shameful is their conduct!  I have seen men of
reputation, when they have been condemned, behaving in the strangest manner:
they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer something dreadful if they
died, and that they could be immortal if you only allowed them to live; and I
think that such are a dishonour to the state, and that any stranger coming in
would have said of them that the most eminent men of Athens, to whom the
Athenians themselves give honour and command, are no better than women.  And I
say that these things ought not to be done by those of us who have a reputation;
and if they are done, you ought not to permit them; you ought rather to show
that you are far more disposed to condemn the man who gets up a doleful scene
and makes the city ridiculous, than him who holds his peace.

                    <p>
But, setting aside the question of public opinion, there seems to be something
wrong in asking a favour of a judge, and thus procuring an acquittal, instead of
informing and convincing him.  For his duty is, not to make a present of
justice, but to give judgment; and he has sworn that he will judge according to
the laws, and not according to his own good pleasure; and we ought not to
encourage you, nor should you allow yourselves to be encouraged, in this habit
of perjury &mdash; there can be no piety in that.  Do not then require me to do
what I consider dishonourable and impious and wrong, especially now, when I am
being tried for impiety on the indictment of Meletus.  For if, O men of Athens,
by force of persuasion and entreaty I could overpower your oaths, then I should
be teaching you to believe that there are no gods, and in defending should
simply convict myself of the charge of not believing in them.  But that is not
so &mdash; far otherwise.  For I do believe that there are gods, and in a sense
higher than that in which any of my accusers believe in them.  And to you and to
God I commit my cause, to be determined by you as is best for you and me.

Someone will say: "Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, and then you

great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this.  For if I tell you

that the unexamined life is not worth living, you are still less likely to
believe me.  Yet I say what is true, although a thing of which it is hard for me

I would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and
live.  For neither in war nor yet at law ought I or any man to use every way of
escaping death. Often in battle there can be no doubt that if a man will throw
away his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death;
and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing
to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not to avoid death, but
to avoid unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death.  I am old and move
slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are keen and
quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them.  And
now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of death &mdash; they
too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and
wrong; and I must abide by my award &mdash; let them abide by theirs. I suppose
that these things may be regarded as fated &mdash; and I think that they are
well.

And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; for I am
about to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic power.  And
I prophesy to you who are my murderers, that immediately after my departure
punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you.  Me
you have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser, and not to give an
account of your lives.  But that will not be as you suppose: far otherwise.  For
I say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now; accusers whom
hitherto I have restrained: and as they are younger they will be more
inconsiderate with you, and you will be more offended at them.  If you think
that by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives, you
are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or
honourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling others, but
to be improving yourselves.  This is the prophecy which I utter before my
departure to the judges who have condemned me.

O my judges &mdash; for you I may truly call judges &mdash; I should like to
tell you of a wonderful circumstance.  Hitherto the divine faculty of which the
internal oracle is the source has constantly been in the habit of opposing me
even about trifles, if I was going to make a slip or error in any matter; and
now as you see there has come upon me that which may be thought, and is
generally believed to be, the last and worst evil.  But the oracle made no sign
of opposition, either when I was leaving my house in the morning, or when I was
on my way to the court, or while I was speaking, at anything which I was going
to say; and yet I have often been stopped in the middle of a speech, but now in
nothing I either said or did touching the matter in hand has the oracle opposed
me.  What do I take to be the explanation of this silence?  I will tell you.  It
is an intimation that what has happened to me is a good, and that those of us
who think that death is an evil are in error.  For the customary sign would
surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to
hope that death is a good; for one of two things &mdash; either death is a state
of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and
migration of the soul from this world to another.  Now if you suppose that there
is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even
by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain.  For if a person were to select
the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare
with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how
many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more
pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man,
but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared
with the others.  Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain;
for eternity is then only a single night.  But if death is the journey to
another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my
friends and judges, can be greater than this?  If indeed when the pilgrim
arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in
this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there, Minos
and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were
righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making.  What would
not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and
Homer?  Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again.  I myself, too, shall
have a wonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with Palamedes, and
Ajax the son of Telamon, and any other ancient hero who has suffered death
through an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in
comparing my own sufferings with theirs.  Above all, I shall then be able to
continue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in
the next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is
not.  What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine the leader of
the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or numberless others, men
and women too!  What infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and
asking them questions!  In another world they do not put a man to death for
asking questions: assuredly not.  For besides being happier than we are, they
will be immortal, if what is said is true.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a certainty, that
no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death.  He and his are
not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching end happened by mere
chance.  But I see clearly that the time had arrived when it was better for me
to die and be released from trouble; wherefore the oracle gave no sign.  For
which reason, also, I am not angry with my condemners, or with my accusers; they
have done me no harm, although they did not mean to do me any good; and for this
I may gently blame them.

ἐν ἔργῳ οὐδενὶ οὔτ᾽ ἐν λόγῳ ἠναντίωταί μοι.  τί οὖν αἴτιον εἶναι ὑπολαμβάνω; ἐγὼ
ὑμῖν ἐρῶ: κινδυνεύει γάρ μοι τὸ συμβεβηκὸς τοῦτο ἀγαθὸν γεγονέναι, καὶ οὐκ ἔσθ᾽
ὅπως ἡμεῖς ὀρθῶς ὑπολαμβάνομεν, ὅσοι οἰόμεθα κακὸν εἶναι τὸ τεθνάναι.  μέγα μοι
τεκμήριον τούτου γέγονεν: οὐ γὰρ ἔσθ᾽ ὅπως οὐκ ἠναντιώθη ἄν μοι τὸ εἰωθὸς
σημεῖον, εἰ μή τι ἔμελλον ἐγὼ ἀγαθὸν πράξειν.
                    </p>
                    <p>
ἐννοήσωμεν δὲ καὶ τῇδε ὡς πολλὴ ἐλπίς ἐστιν ἀγαθὸν αὐτὸ εἶναι.  δυοῖν γὰρ
θάτερόν ἐστιν τὸ τεθνάναι: ἢ γὰρ οἷον μηδὲν εἶναι μηδὲ αἴσθησιν μηδεμίαν μηδενὸς
ἔχειν τὸν τεθνεῶτα, ἢ κατὰ τὰ λεγόμενα μεταβολή τις τυγχάνει οὖσα καὶ μετοίκησις
τῇ ψυχῇ τοῦ τόπου τοῦ ἐνθένδε εἰς ἄλλον τόπον.  καὶ εἴτε δὴ μηδεμία αἴσθησίς
ἐστιν ἀλλ᾽ οἷον ὕπνος ἐπειδάν τις καθεύδων μηδ᾽ ὄναρ μηδὲν ὁρᾷ, θαυμάσιον κέρδος
ἂν εἴη ὁ θάνατος—ἐγὼ γὰρ ἂν οἶμαι, εἴ τινα ἐκλεξάμενον δέοι ταύτην τὴν νύκτα ἐν
ᾗ οὕτω κατέδαρθεν ὥστε μηδὲ ὄναρ ἰδεῖν, καὶ τὰς ἄλλας νύκτας τε καὶ ἡμέρας τὰς
τοῦ βίου τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ ἀντιπαραθέντα ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ δέοι σκεψάμενον εἰπεῖν πόσας
ἄμεινον καὶ ἥδιον ἡμέρας καὶ νύκτας ταύτης τῆς νυκτὸς βεβίωκεν ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦ βίῳ,
οἶμαι ἂν μὴ ὅτι ἰδιώτην τινά, ἀλλὰ τὸν μέγαν βασιλέα εὐαριθμήτους ἂν εὑρεῖν
αὐτὸν ταύτας πρὸς τὰς ἄλλας ἡμέρας καὶ νύκτας—εἰ οὖν τοιοῦτον ὁ θάνατός ἐστιν,
κέρδος ἔγωγε λέγω: καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲν πλείων ὁ πᾶς χρόνος φαίνεται οὕτω δὴ εἶναι ἢ
μία νύξ.  εἰ δ᾽ αὖ οἷον ἀποδημῆσαί ἐστιν ὁ θάνατος ἐνθένδε εἰς ἄλλον τόπον, καὶ
ἀληθῆ ἐστιν τὰ λεγόμενα, ὡς ἄρα ἐκεῖ εἰσι πάντες οἱ τεθνεῶτες, τί μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν
τούτου εἴη ἄν, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί; εἰ γάρ τις ἀφικόμενος εἰς Ἅιδου, ἀπαλλαγεὶς
τουτωνὶ τῶν φασκόντων δικαστῶν εἶναι, εὑρήσει τοὺς ὡς ἀληθῶς δικαστάς, οἵπερ καὶ
λέγονται ἐκεῖ δικάζειν, Μίνως τε καὶ Ῥαδάμανθυς καὶ Αἰακὸς καὶ Τριπτόλεμος καὶ
ἄλλοι ὅσοι τῶν ἡμιθέων δίκαιοι ἐγένοντο ἐν τῷ ἑαυτῶν βίῳ, ἆρα φαύλη ἂν εἴη ἡ
ἀποδημία; ἢ αὖ Ὀρφεῖ συγγενέσθαι καὶ Μουσαίῳ καὶ Ἡσιόδῳ καὶ Ὁμήρῳ ἐπὶ πόσῳ ἄν
τις δέξαιτ᾽ ἂν ὑμῶν; ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ πολλάκις ἐθέλω τεθνάναι εἰ ταῦτ᾽ ἔστιν ἀληθῆ.
ἐπεὶ ἔμοιγε καὶ αὐτῷ θαυμαστὴ ἂν εἴη ἡ διατριβὴ αὐτόθι, ὁπότε ἐντύχοιμι
Παλαμήδει καὶ Αἴαντι τῷ Τελαμῶνος καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος τῶν παλαιῶν διὰ κρίσιν ἄδικον
τέθνηκεν, ἀντιπαραβάλλοντι τὰ ἐμαυτοῦ πάθη πρὸς τὰ ἐκείνων—ὡς ἐγὼ οἶμαι, οὐκ ἂν
ἀηδὲς εἴη—καὶ δὴ τὸ μέγιστον, τοὺς ἐκεῖ ἐξετάζοντα καὶ ἐρευνῶντα ὥσπερ τοὺς
ἐνταῦθα διάγειν, τίς αὐτῶν σοφός ἐστιν καὶ τίς οἴεται μέν, ἔστιν δ᾽ οὔ.  ἐπὶ
πόσῳ δ᾽ ἄν τις, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, δέξαιτο ἐξετάσαι τὸν ἐπὶ Τροίαν ἀγαγόντα τὴν
πολλὴν στρατιὰν ἢ Ὀδυσσέα ἢ Σίσυφον ἢ ἄλλους μυρίους ἄν τις εἴποι καὶ ἄνδρας καὶ
γυναῖκας, οἷς ἐκεῖ διαλέγεσθαι καὶ συνεῖναι καὶ ἐξετάζειν ἀμήχανον ἂν εἴη
εὐδαιμονίας; πάντως οὐ δήπου τούτου γε ἕνεκα οἱ ἐκεῖ ἀποκτείνουσι: τά τε γὰρ
ἄλλα εὐδαιμονέστεροί εἰσιν οἱ ἐκεῖ τῶν ἐνθάδε, καὶ ἤδη τὸν λοιπὸν χρόνον
ἀθάνατοί εἰσιν, εἴπερ γε τὰ λεγόμενα ἀληθῆ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑμᾶς χρή, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, εὐέλπιδας εἶναι πρὸς τὸν θάνατον, καὶ ἕν
τι τοῦτο διανοεῖσθαι ἀληθές, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνδρὶ ἀγαθῷ κακὸν οὐδὲν οὔτε ζῶντι
οὔτε τελευτήσαντι, οὐδὲ ἀμελεῖται ὑπὸ θεῶν τὰ τούτου πράγματα: οὐδὲ τὰ ἐμὰ νῦν
ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτομάτου γέγονεν, ἀλλά μοι δῆλόν ἐστι τοῦτο, ὅτι ἤδη τεθνάναι καὶ
ἀπηλλάχθαι πραγμάτων βέλτιον ἦν μοι.  διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἐμὲ οὐδαμοῦ ἀπέτρεψεν τὸ
σημεῖον, καὶ ἔγωγε τοῖς καταψηφισαμένοις μου καὶ τοῖς κατηγόροις οὐ πάνυ
χαλεπαίνω.  καίτοι οὐ ταύτῃ τῇ διανοίᾳ κατεψηφίζοντό μου καὶ κατηγόρουν, ἀλλ᾽
οἰόμενοι βλάπτειν: τοῦτο αὐτοῖς ἄξιον μέμφεσθαι.

Still I have a favour to ask of them.  When my sons are grown up, I would ask
you, O my friends, to punish them; and I would have you trouble them, as I have
troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything, more than about
virtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are really nothing &mdash;
then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about that for which
they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when they are really
nothing.  And if you do this, both I and my sons will have received justice at
your hands.
